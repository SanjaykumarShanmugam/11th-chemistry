**François - Marie Raoult**

François - Marie Raoult was a French chemist who conducted research into the behaviour of solutions, especially their physical properties.

In his first research paper, he described the action of solutes in depressing the freezing point of the solutions. He also gave a relation between the vapour pressure of the solution with the molecular wight of the solute.

**9.1 INTRODUCTION**

ere are many chemicals that play an important r daily life. All these chemicals are in different

forms, viz solid, liquid and gas. If we do close ion on their composition, we could find that hem are mixtures and rarely pure substances. e interesting aspect is that most of the mixtures geneous irrespective of their physical state and ogeneous mixtures are called as solutions.




  

Sea water is one of the naturally existing solutions which covers more than 70% of the earth’s surface. We cannot imagine life on earth without sea water. It contains many dissolved solids, mostly NaCl. Another important naturally occurring solution is air. Air is a homogeneous mixture of nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide, and other trace gases. Even solid material such as brass is a homogeneous mixture of copper and zinc.

In the above examples the solutions are in different physical states viz... liquid (sea water), gas (air) and solid (alloys), and one common property of all the above is their homogeneity. The homogeneity implies uniform distribution of their constituents or components throughout the mixture. In this chapter, we learn about the solutions and their properties.

**9.2 Types of solutions**

A solution is a homogeneous mixture of two or more substances, consisting of atoms, ions or molecules. The compound that is present in largest amount in a homogeneous mixture is called the solvent, and others are solutes. For example, when a small amount of NaCl is dissolved in water, a homogeneous solution is obtained. In this solution, Na+ and Cl- ions are uniformly distributed in water. Here water is the solvent as the amount of water is more compared to the amount of NaCl present in this solution, and NaCl is the solute.

The commonly used solutions are the solutions in which a solid solute is dissolved in a liquid solvent. However, solute or solvent can be in any of the three states of matter (solid, liquid, gas). If water is used as  

the solvent,the resultant solution is called as an aqueous solution. If solvents (Benzene, CCl4, ether etc.,) other than water is used, then the resultant solution is called as a non- aqueous solution.

The following table illustrates the different types of solutions based on the physical state of the solute and solvent.

EDTA, the reaction between EDTA and the metal ions takes place in the 1:1 mole ratio and hence molar solutions are used in this titrations. In the redox and neutralisation titrations we use normal solutions. The mole fraction is used to calculate the partial pressure of gases and the vapour pressure of solutions. The percentage units are used to express the active ingredients present in therapeutics, and the ppm is used to express the quantity of solutes present in small amounts in solutions. **9.3.1 Standard solutions and working**

**standards** A standard solution or a stock solution is a solution whose concentration is accurately known. A standard solution of required concentration can be prepared by dissolving a required amount of a solute, in a suitable amount of solvent. Its done by (i) transforming a known amount of a solute to a standard flask of definite volume. (ii) a small amount of water is added to the flask and shaken well to dissolve the solute. (iii) then water is added to the flask to bring the solution level to the mark indicated at the top end of the flask. (iv) the flask is stoppered and shaken well to make concentration uniform.

At the time of experiment, the solution with required concentration is prepared by diluting the stock solution. This diluted solution is usually called working standard. A known volume of stock solution is transferred to a new container and brought to the calculated volume. The necessary volumes of the stock solution and final volume can be calculated using the following expression.

Cs Vs = Cw Vw ----------(9.1)  

Where the Cs & Vs are concentration and volume of the stock solution and Cw

& Vw are concentration and volume of the working standard, respectively.

**9.3.2 Advantages of using standard solutions:**

1\. The error in weighing the solute can be minimised by using concentrated stock solution that requires large quantity of solute.

2\. We can prepare working standards of different concentrations by diluting the stock solution, which is more efficient since consistency is maintained.

3\. Some of the concentrated solutions are more stable and are less likely to support microbial growth than working standards used in the experiments.

**Example Problem 1**

1\. What volume of 4M HCl and 2M HCl should be mixed to get 500 mL of 2.5 M HCl?

Let the volume of 4M HCl required to prepare 500 mL of 2.5 MHCl = x mL

Therefore, the required volume of 2M HCl = (500 - x) mL

We know from the equation (9.1)

C1V1+ C2V2 = C3V3

(4x)+2(500-x) = 2.5 × 500

4x+1000-2x = 1250

2x = 1250 - 1000

x = 250 2

\= 125 mL




  

Hence, volume of 4M HCl required = 125 mL

Volume of 2M HCl required = (500 - 125) mL=

? 5) Describe how would you prepare the follow

(a) 1 L of aqueous solution of 1.5 M CoCl2.

**Gaseous solute in liquid solvent:**

In the case of gaseous solute in liquid solvent, the solubility decreases with increase in temperature. When a gaseous solute dissolves in a liquid solvent, its molecules interact with solvent molecules with weak intermolecular forces. When the temperature increases, the average kinetic energy of the molecules present in the solution also increases. The increase in kinetic energy breaks the weak intermolecular forces between the gaseous solute and liquid solvent which results in the release of the dissolved gas molecules to the gaseous state. Moreover, the dissolution of most of the gases in liquid solvents is an exothermic process, and in such processes, the increase in temperature decreases the dissolution of gaseous molecules.

**Activity:**

Open the soda bottle and put a balloon over it. The balloon will inflate with the released carbon dioxide from the soda. Carry out the same experiment by placing the soda bottle in a container of hot water. You will observe the balloon is inflated much faster now. This shows the decrease in solubility of gases in solution with increase in temperature. In the rivers where hot water is discharged from industrial plants, the aquatic lives are less sustained due to the decreased availability of dissolved oxygen.  

**Under normal conditions**

**More gas molecules are soluble at higher pressure**

**When pressure is increased**

**Figure 9.2 Effect of pressure on solubility**

**Effect of pressure:**

Generally the change in pressure does not have any significant effect in the solubility of solids and liquids as they are not compressible. However, the solubility of gases generally increases with increase of pressure.

Consider a saturated solution of a gaseous solute dissolved in a liquid solvent in a closed container. In such a system, the following equilibrium exists.

Gas (in gaseous state) ⇆ Gas (in solution)

According to Le-Chatelier principle, the increase in pressure will shift the equilibrium in the direction which will reduce the pressure. Therefore, more number of gaseous molecules dissolves in the solvent and the solubility increases.

**9.5 Henry's law**

William Henry investigated the relationship between pressure and solubility of a gaseous solute in a particular solvent. According to him, “the partial pressure of the gas in vapour phase (vapour pressure of




  

the solute) is directly proportional to the mole fr at low concentrations”. This statement is known

Henry’s law can be expressed as,

psolute α xsolute in solution

psolute = KHxsolute in solution

Here, psolute represents the partial pressure called as vapour pressure. xsolute in solution repres KH is a empirical constant with the dimensions nature of the gaseous solute and solvent. The ab y=mx. The plot partial pressure of the gas agai straight line as shown in fig 9.3. The slope of the

The above expression gives the relative lowering of vapour pressure. Based  

on this expression, Raoult’s Law can also be stated as “the relative lowering of vapour pressure of an ideal solution containing the nonvolatile solute is equal to the mole fraction of the solute at a given temperature”.

**Comparison of Raoult’s law and Henry’s law**

According to Raoult’s law, for a solution containing a nonvolatile solute

psolute = p°solutexsolute ---------- (9.17)

According to Henry’s law:

psolute = KHxsolute in solution ---------- (9.18)

The difference between the above two expressions is the proportionality constant p°A (Raoults Law) and KH.(Henry's Law). Henry's law is applicable to solution containing gaseous solute in liquid solvent, while the Raoult's Law is applicable to nonvolatile solid solute in a liquid solvent. If the solute is non volatile then the Henry's law constant will become equal to the vapour pressure of the pure solvent (p°A) and thus, Raoult’s law becomes a special case of Henry’s law. For very dilute solutions the solvent obeys Raoult’s law and the solute obeys Henry’s law.

**9.8 Ideal and non-ideal solutions**

**9.8.1 Ideal Solutions:**

An ideal solution is a solution in which each component i.e. the solute as well as the solvent obeys the Raoult’s law over the entire range of concentration. Practically no solution is ideal over the entire range of concentration. However,




  

when the concentration of solute is very low, the dilute solution behaves ideally. If the two components present in the solution (A and B) are identical in size, structure, and having almost similar intermolecular attractive forces between them (i.e. between A-A, B-B and B-A) and then the solution tends to behave like an ideal solution.

**For an ideal solution**

1\. There is no change in the volume on mixing the two components (solute & solvents). (ΔVmixing= 0)

2\. There is no exchange of heat when the solute is dissolved in solvent (ΔHmixing = 0).

3\. Escaping tendency of the solute and the solvent present in it should be same as in pure liquids.

**Examples for ideal solutions: (**Benzene & Toluene) ; (n-hexane & n-heptane) ; (Ethyl bromide & Ethyl iodide) ; (Chlorobenzene & Bromobenzene).

**9.8.2 Non-ideal solutions**

The solutions which do not obey Raoult’s law over the entire range of concentration, are called non-ideal solutions. For a non-ideal solution, there is a change in the volume and enthalpy upon mixing. i.e. ΔHmixing ≠ 0 & ΔVmixing ≠ 0. The deviation of the non-ideal solutions from the Raoult’s law can either be positive or negative.

**Non-ideal solutions - positive deviation from Rauolt's Law:**

The nature of the deviation from the Rauolt’s law can be explained in terms of the  

intermolecular interactions between solute (B) and solvent (A). Consider a case in which the intermolecular attractive forces between A and B are weaker than those between the molecules of A (A-A) and molecules of B (B- B). The molecules present in such a solution have a greater tendency to escape from the solution when compared to the ideal solution formed by A and B, in which the intermolecular attractive forces (A-A, B-B, A-B) are almost similar. Consequently, the vapour pressure of such non-ideal solution increases and it is greater than the sum of the vapour pressure of A and B as predicted by the Raoult’s law. This type of deviation is called positive deviation.

Here, pA > p°A xA and pB > p°B xB.

Hence ptotal > p°A xA + p°B xB ----------(9.19)

Let us understand the positive deviation by considering a solution of ethyl alcohol and water. In this solution the hydrogen bonding interaction between ethanol and water is weaker than those hydrogen bonding interactions amongst themselves (ethyl alcohol-ethyl alcohol and water-water interactions). This results in the increased evaporation of both components (H2O and C2H5OH) from the aqueous solution of ethanol. Consequently, the vapour pressure of the solution is greater than the vapour pressure predicted by Raoult’s law. Here, the mixing process is endothermic i.e. ΔHmixing> 0 and there will be a slight increase in volume (ΔVmixing> 0).

**Examples for non-ideal solutions showing positive deviations:** Ethyl alcohol & cyclohexane, Benzene & acetone, Carbon tetrachloride & chloroform, Acetone & ethyl alcohol, Ethyl alcohol & water.

**Fig 9.9 Acetic acid (dimer)**

**iv) Temperature**

An increase in temperature of the solution increases the average kinetic energy of the molecules present in the solution which causes decrease in the attractive force between them. As a result, the solution deviates from ideal behaviour.

**v) Pressure**

At high pressure the molecules tend to stay close to each other and therefore there will be an increase in their intermolecular attraction. Thus, a solution deviates from Raoult’s law at high pressure.

**vi) Concentration**

If a solution is sufficiently dilute there is no pronounced solvent-solute interaction because the number of solute molecules are very low compared to the solvent. When the concentration is increased by adding solute, the solvent-solute interaction becomes significant. This causes deviation from the Raoult’s law.

**9.9 Colligative properties**

Pure water is tasteless. When you add sugar it becomes sweet, while addition of salt makes it salty. It implies that the properties of a solution depend on the nature of solute particles present in the solution. However, for an ideal dilute solution, the properties, namely, relative lowering of vapour pressure, elevation of boiling point, depression in freezing point and osmotic pressure do not depend on the chemical nature of the solute but depends only on the number of solute particles (ions/molecules) present in the solution. These four properties are known as colligative properties. Though the magnitude of these properties are small, they have plenty of practical applications. For example the osmotic pressure is important for some vital biological systems.




  

**Relative lowering of vapour pressure**

**Elevation of boiling point**

Boiling point is an important physical property of a liquid. The boiling point of a liquid is the temperature at which its vapour pressure becomes equal to the atmospheric pressure (1 atm). When a nonvolatile solute is added to a pure solvent at its boiling point, the vapour pressure of the solution is lowered below 1 atm. To bring the vapour pressure again to 1 atm, the temperature of the solution has to be increased. As a result,the solution boils at a higher temperature (Tb) than the boiling point of the pure solvent (Tb

°). This increase

**Depression in freezing point**

Freezing point of a substance is another important physical property like boiling point. Freezing point is defined as “the temperature at which the solid and the liquid states of the substance have the same vapour pressure”. At freezing point, the solid and liquid phases of the substance are in equilibrium. For example, the freezing point of water is 0 ˚C. At this temperature the ice and water are in equilibrium. When a nonvolatile solute is added to water at its freezing point, the freezing point of the solution is lowered from 0 ˚C. The lowering of the freezing point of the solvent when a solute is added is called depression in freezing point (ΔTf).

From the above graph, we infer that the freezing point (Tf

o) is 0 ˚C as the vapour pressure at this temperature is 1 atm (atmospheric pressure). The vapour pressure versus temperature curve for the solution indicates that the freezing point (Tf) is lower than the 0 ˚C. The depression in freezing temperature (ΔTf) can be expressed as,

ΔTf = Tf

o- Tf

The experimental results show that the depression in freezing point is directly proportional to the molal concentration of the solute particles.

Hence,

ΔTf α m

ΔTf=Kf m ........(9.30)

Here, ‘m’ = is the molality of the solution

Kf = molal freezing point depression constant or cryoscopic constant.

If m=1 then ΔTf =Kf

The Kf is equal to the depression in freezing point for 1 molal solution

**Osmosis and osmotic pressure**

Many biological processes depend on osmosis, which is a spontaneous process by which the solvent molecules pass through a semi permeable membrane from a solution of lower concentration to a solution of higher concentration. The name osmosis is derived from the Greek word ‘_osmos_’ which means ‘to push’. It is also important to know that the semipermeable membrane selectively  

allows certain molecules in the solution to pass through it but not others.

**Figure 9.12 Osmosis and osmotic pressure**

Let us consider a simple apparatus as shown in the above figure. A semipermeable membrane separates a chamber into two compartments. Water (pure solvent) is added to the first compartment and the aqueous NaCl (solution) is added to the second compartment such that the liquid levels on the both sides are equal. Since there is a difference in concentration between the liquids present in the two compartments, the water molecules move from first compartment to second compartment through the semipermeable membrane. The membrane allows only water molecules to pass through it in either direction but not NaCl. The net flow of water is into the sodium chloride solution and hence increases its volume. This decreases its concentration and also creates a pressure difference between the compartments. This pressure difference, push some of the water molecules back to the solvent side through the semipermeable membrane until an equilibrium is established. At the equilibrium, the rate of movement of solvent molecules on both directions are equal. The pressure difference at the equilibrium is called osmotic pressure (π). Thus, osmotic pressure can be defined as “the pressure







  

that must be applied to the solution to stop the influx of the solvent (to stop osmosis) through the semipermeable membrane”

van’t Hoff found out that for dilute solutions, the osmotic pressure is directly proportional to the molar concentration of the solute and the temperature of the solution. He proposed the following equation to calculate osmotic pressure which is now called as van’t Hoff equation.

π = CRT ------ 9.31

Here, C = Concentration of the solution in molarity T = Temperature R = Gas constant **Determination of molar mass from osmotic pressure**

According to van’t Hoff equation

π = CRT n V

Here, n= number of moles of solute dissolved in ‘V’ litre of the solution.

Therefore, n RT V

If the solution is prepared by dissolving wB g of nonvolatile solute in wA g of solvent, then the number of moles of solute (n) is,

n= wB/MB

Here, MB = molar mass of the solute

Substituting the ‘n’ in (9.33), we get,

From the equation 9.33, molar mass of the solute can be calculated.

**Significances of osmotic pressure over other colligative properties**

Unlike elevation of boiling point (for 1 molal solution the elevation in boiling point is 0.512 ˚C for water) and the depression in freezing point (for 1 molal solution the depression in freezing point is 1.86 ˚C for water), the magnitude of osmotic pressure is large.

The osmotic pressure can be measured at room temperature enables to determine the molecular mass of biomolecules which are unstable at higher temperatures.

Even for a very dilute solution, the osmotic pressure is large.

**Isotonic solutions**

Two solutions having same osmotic pressure at a given temperature are called isotonic solutions. When such solutions are separated by a semipermeable membrane, solvent flow between one to the other on either direction is same, i.e. the net solvent flow between the two isotonic solutions is zero.

**Figure 9.13 Isotonic solutions**

The osmotic pressure of the blood cells is approximately equal to 7 atm at 37˚C. The intravenous injections should have same osmotic pressure as that of




  

the blood (isotonic with blood). If the Intravenous solutions are too dilute that is hypotonic, the solvent from outside of the cells will flow into the cell to normalise the osmotic pressure and this process which is called hemolysis, causes the cells to burst. On the other hand, if the solution is too concentrated, that is hypertonic, the solvent molecules will flow out of the cells, which causes the cells to shrink and die. For this reason, the Intravenous fluids are prepared such they are isotonic to blood (0.9 % mass/ volume sodium chloride solution).

**9.10 Reverse osmosis (RO):**

Let us consider the experimental setup (Figure 9.15) discussed in the osmosis. The pure water moves through the semipermeable membrane to the NaCl solution due to osmosis. This process can be reversed by applying pressure greater than the osmotic pressure to the solution side. Now the pure water moves from the solution side to the solvent side and this process is called reverse osmosis. It can be defined as a process in which a solvent passes through a semipermeable membrane in the opposite direction of osmosis, when subjected to a hydrostatic pressure greater than the osmotic pressure.

**Application of Reverse osmosis in water purification:**

**Figure 9.14 Osmosis & Reverse osmosis**  

Reverse osmosis is used in the desalination of sea water and also in the purification of drinking water. A simple set up used in both the process is shown in the figure 9.15. When a pressure higher than the osmotic pressure is applied on the solution side (sea water) the water molecules moves from solution side to the solvent side through semipermeable membrane (Opposite to the Osmotic flow). Pure water can be collected. There are different types of semipermeable membranes used in this process. The membrane used for reverse osmosis has to withstand high pressures. Generally, cellulose acetate or polyamide membranes are commonly used in commercial systems. The selection of membrane used for reverse osmosis will be decided based on the nature of the input water.

**9.11 Abnormal molar mass**

The molar masses of the nonvolatile solutes can be calculated accurately using the experimentally determined colligative properties. In this method, we assume that the solution is very dilute and there is no dissociation or association of solute particles in the solution.

In a concentrated solution, the interaction between the solute and solvent becomes significant and reflected in the measured colligative properties. Similarly, the dissociation or association of solute molecules would alter the total number of particles present in the solution and hence affect the results of measured colligative properties. In such solutions, the value of the molar mass of the solute determined using colligative properties would be different from the actual molar mass, and it is called abnormal molar mass.

**Association or dissociation of solute molecules**:

Normally, the molar mass determination using measured colligative properties assumes that the solute does not dissociate or associate. In certain solvents, solute molecules associate to form a dimer or trimer etc… This reduces the total number of particles (molecules) formed in solution and as a result the calculated molar mass will be higher than the actual molar mass. Let us consider a solution of acetic acid in benzene. It is already established that acetic acid forms inter molecular hydrogen bonds as shown in the figure 9.9 and exists as a dimer in benzene.

2CH3COOH →(CH3COOH)2

The molar mass of acetic acid calculated using colligative properties is

i Normal actual molar m

Observed abnormal mola

\= ( )

( )  

found to be around 120 g mol-1 is two times the actual molar mass (60 g mol-1).

The electrolytes such as KCl or NaCl dissociates completely into its constitutent ions in their aqueous solution. This causes an increase in the total number of particles (ions) present in the solution. The calculated molar mass using colligative property measurement for this type of solutions will be lower than the actual molar mass. For example, sodium chloride dissociates into Na+ ions and Cl- ions in aqueous solution, as shown below.

NaCl (s) → Na+ (aq) + Cl– (aq)

When we dissolve 1 mole of NaCl (58.4 g) in water, it dissociates and gives 1 mole of Na+ and 1 mole of Cl-. Hence, the solution will have 2 moles of particles. Thus, the colligative properties would be double the expected value.

**van’t Hoff factor** We have learnt that the dissociation or association of solute molecules in a solution will result in the increase or decrease in the calculated molar mass using the colligative property. This variation is proportional to the extent of association or dissociation. To quantify the extent of association or dissociation of solutes in solution, van’t Hoff introduced a term 'i' which is now called van’t Hoff factor. It is defined as the ratio of the actual molar mass to the abnormal (calculated) molar mass of the solute. Here, the abnormal molar mass is the molar mass calculated using the experimentally determined colligative property.

The estimated Van’t Hoff factor for acetic acid solution in Benzene is 0.5 and that of sodium chloride solution in water is 2. The degree of dissociation or association can be related to Van't Hoff factor (i) using the following relationships

αdissociation = i–1 n–1

(Where n is number ions /species formed by the dissociation of a single molecule)

αassociation = (1–i)n n–1

(here, n is the number of solute involved in association.

The equations relating the four colligative properties with the concentration of the solutes can be rewritten as follows by incorporating the van’t Hoff factor

For a solute that does not dissociate or associate the van’t Hoff factor is equal to 1 (i = 1) and the molar mass will be close to the actual molar mass.  

For the solutes that associate to form higher oligomers in solution the van’t Hoff factor will be less than one (i <1) and the observed molar mass will be greater than the actual molar mass.

For solutes that dissociates into their constituent ions the van’t Hoff factor will be more than one (i > 1) and the observed molar mass will be less than the normal molar mass.

**SUMMARY**

• A solution is a homogeneous mixture of two or more chemically non- reacting substances mixed uniformly. The proportion of component which is more in the solution is called solvent and the lesser component is called solute.

• The different concentration units used to prepare the solutions are formality, molality , normality, molarity, molefraction, %w/w solution, %w/v solution, %v/v solution. If the solute quantity is very minimum then ppm unit is used to express its concentration.

• The standard solutions are prepared and diluted to desired concentration (working standards). This helps in overcoming the error due to weighing and maintain efficiency and consistency in the preparation of solution.

• Solubility is defined as the amount of solute in a saturated solution per 100g of a solvent. Solubility of a solute in a solvent depends on the nature of the solute and solvent , temperature.

• The solubility of a gas in a liquid depends upon, the nature of the gas and the nature of the liquid, the temperature of the system, and the pressure of the gas.

• The effect of pressure on the solubility of a gas in a liquid is governed by Henry’s Law. It states that the solubility of a gas in a liquid at a given temperature in directly proportional to the partial pressure of the gas.  

• The vapour pressure of a liquid is the pressure exerted by its vapour when it is in dynamic equilibrium with its liquid, in a closed container. According to Raoults Law, the vapour pressure of a solution containing a non-volatile solute is directly proportional to the mole fraction of the solvent ( XA). The proportionality constant being the vapour pressure of the pure solvent.

• The solution shows positive deviation from Raoult’s Law if its vapour pressure is higher than that predicted by Raoult’s Law for example ethyl alcohol and cyclohexane.

• The solution shows negative deviation if its vapour pressure is lower than that predicted by Raoult’s Law for example acetone and chloroform.

• Colligative properties of solutions are those properties which depend only upon the number of solute particles in the solution and not on their nature. Such properties are

• (a) Relative lowering in vapour pressure: On addition of a non volatile solute it is observed that the vapour pressure of the solution is lesser than the solvent. According to Raolut's law relative lowering of vapour pressure is equal to the mole fraction of the solute.

• (b) Elevation of boiling point∆Tb: The solution boils at a higher temperature than the pure solvent. This is due to the decreased vapour pressure of solution and the temperature it reaches the atmospheric pressure on heating to boil is much higher than the solvent.

• (c) Depression of freezing point:




  

The freezing point of the solution is much lower than the solvent as the temperature at which the solid and the liquid have the same vapour pressure is much lower than the solvent.

• (d) Osmotic pressure: The spontaneous flow of solvent molecules from a dilute solution into a concentrated solution when the two are separated by a perfect semipermeable membrane is called osmosis.

• Osmotic pressure (π) is the pressure which must be applied to the solution side (more concentrated solution) to just prevent the passage of pure solvent into it through a semipermeable membrane.

• Abnormal colligative properties

• If solutes undergo any association or dissociation in a solutiont, they exhibit abnormal colligative properties Van't Hoft factor explains quantitatively the extent of association or dissociation of soluts in solvent.
