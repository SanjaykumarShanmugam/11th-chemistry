8.7.2 Predicting the direction of a reaction

From the knowledge of equilibrium constant, it is possible to predict the direction in which the net reaction is taking place for a given concentration or partial pressure of reactants and products.

Consider a general homogeneous reversible reaction,

_x_A + _y_B ⇌ _l_C + _m_D

For the above reaction under non- equilibrium conditions, reaction quotient ‘Q’ is defined as the ratio of the product of active masses of reaction products raised to the respective stoichiometric coefficients in the balanced chemical equation to that of the reactants.

Under non-equilibrium conditions, the reaction quotient Q can be calculated using the following expression.

Q C D A

m

\= \[ \] \[ \] \[ \] \[B\]x y

_l_

As the reaction proceeds, there is a continuous change in the concentration of  

reactants and products and also the Q value until the reaction reaches the equilibrium. At equilibrium Q is equal to Kc at a particular temperature. Once the equilibrium is attained, there is no change in the Q value. By knowing the Q value, we can predict the direction of the reaction by comparing it with Kc.

• If Q = Kc, the reaction is in equilibrium state.

• If Q > Kc, the reaction will proceed in the reverse direction i.e., formation of reactants.

• If Q < Kc, the reaction will proceed in the forward direction i.e., formation of products.

Example 1

The value of Kc for the following reaction at 717 K is 48.

H2(g) + I2(g) ⇌ 2HI(g)

At a particular instant, the concentration of H2, I2and HI are found to be 0.2 mol L-1, 0.2 mol L-1 and 0.6 mol L-1 respectively. From the above information we can predict the direction of reaction as follows.

Since Q< Kc, the reaction will proceed in the forward direction.

N2O4 (g) ⇌ 2NO2(g)

Kc = 0.21 at 373 K. The concentrations N2O4 and NO2 are found to be 0.125 mol dm-3 and 0.5 mol dm-3

respectively at a given time. From the above information we can predict the direction of reaction as follows.

The Q value is greater than Kc. Hence, the reaction will proceed in the reverse direction until the Q value reaches 0.21

3) The following water gas shift reaction is an important industrial process for the production of hydrogen gas.

CO(g) + H2O(g) ⇌ CO2(g) + H2(g) At a given temperature Kp = 2.7. If 0.13 mol of CO, 0.56 mol of water, 0.78 mol of CO2 and 0.28 mol of H2 are introduced into a 2 L flask, and find out in which direction must the reaction proceed to reach equilibrium

**8.7.3 Calculation of concentration of reactants and products at equilibrium**

Let us consider the formation of HI in which, ‘a’ moles of hydrogen and ‘b’ moles of iodine gas are allowed to react in a container of volume V. Let ‘x’ moles of each of H2 and I2 react together to form 2x moles of HI.
