## 8.6 Law of mass action

In 1864 two Norwegian chemists namely Maximilian Guldberg and Peter Waage formulated the law of mass action, based on the experimental studies of many reversible reactions. The law states that,

“At any instant, the rate of a chemical reaction at a given temperature is directly proportional to the product of the active masses of the reactants at that instant”.

Rate α \[Reactant\]x

where, x is the stoichiometric coefficient of the reactant and the square bracket represents the active mass (concentration) of the reactants.

Active mass = n V

  

   mol dm-3(or) mol L-1




  

where n is the number of moles and V is the volume of the container (dm3 or L)

8.6.1 Equilibrium constants (Kp and Kc):

Let us consider a reversible reaction,

_x_A+yB ⇌ _l_C + _m_D

where, A and B are the reactants, C and D are the products and x,y,_l_ and m are the stoichiometric coefficients of A, B, C and D, respectively.

Applying the law of mass action, the rate of the forward reaction,

rf α \[A\]x \[B\]y (or) rf = kf \[A\]x \[B\]y

Similarly, the rate of the backward reaction,

rb α \[C\]_l_ \[D\]m

(or)

rb = kb \[C\]_l_\[D\]m

where kf and kb are proportionality constants

At equilibrium,

Rate of forward reaction (rf)

kf \[A\]_x_ \[B\]y = kb \[C\]_l_ \[D\]m

or kf

kb

\[C\]_l_ \[D\]_m_

\[A\]_x_ \[B\]_y_ Kc= =

where, Kc is the equilibrium constant in terms of concentration (active mass).  

At a given temperature, the ratio of the product of active masses of reaction products raised to the respective stoichiometric coefficients in the balanced chemical equation to that of the reactants is a constant, known as equilibrium constant. Later when we study chemical kinetics we will learn that this is only approximately true.

If the reactants and products of the above reaction are in gas phase, then the equilibrium constant can be written in terms of partial pressures as indicated below,

Kp

pC _l_ × pD

_m_ =

pA _x_ × pB

_y_

Where, pA, pB, pC,and pD are the partial pressures of the gas A, B, C and D, respectively.

8.6.2 Relation between Kp and Kc

Let us consider the general reaction in which all reactants and products are ideal gases.

_x_A+_y_B ⇌ _l_C +_m_D

The equilibrium constant, Kc is

Kc

\[C\]_l_ \[D\]_m_

\[A\]_x_ \[B\]_y_ \= (1)

and Kp is,

Kp

pC _l_ × pD

_m_ =

pA _x_ × pB

_y_ (2)

The ideal gas equation is




  

PV nRT or

P n V

RT

\=

Since

Active mass = molar concentration = n/V P = active mass × (RT)

Based on the above expression the partial pressure of the reactants and products can be expressed as,

pA _x_ = \[A\]_x_ (RT)_x_

pB _y_ = \[B\]_y_ (RT)_y_

pC _1_ \= \[C\]_l_ (RT)_l_

pD _m_ \= \[D\]_m_ (RT)_m_

On substitution in Eqn. 2,

Kp

\[C\]_l_ \[RT\]_l_ \[D\]_m_ (RT)_m_

\= \[A\]_x_ \[RT\]_x_ \[B\]_y_ (RT)_y_

(3)

(4)

Kp

\[C\]_l_ \[D\]_m_ (RT)_l+m_

\= \[A\]_x_ \[B\]_y_ (RT)_x+y_

Kp

\[C\]_l_ \[D\]_m_

\= \[A\]_x_ \[B\]_y_ (RT)(_l+m) - (x+y)_

By comparing equation (1) and (4), we get

Kp = Kc (RT)Δng (5)

where, Δng is the difference between the sum of number of moles of products and the sum of number of moles of reactants in the gas phase.  

The following relations become immediately obvious.

When Δng = 0

Kp = Kc (RT)0

**Kp = Kc**

**Examples:**

**1\.** H2(g) + I2(g) ⇌ 2HI (g)

**2\.** N2 (g) +O2 (g) ⇌ 2NO(g)

When Δng = +ve

Kp = Kc (_RT_)+ve

**Kp>Kc**

**Examples:**

**1\.** 2NH3(g) ⇌ N2 (g) + 3H2 (g)

**2\.** PCI5 (g) ⇌ PCl3 (g) + Cl2 (g)

When Δng = -ve

Kp = Kc (RT)-ve

**Kp< Kc**

**Examples:**

**1\.** 2H2(g) + O2(g) ⇌ 2H2O (g)

**2\.** 2SO2(g) + O2(g) ⇌ 2SO3 (g)
