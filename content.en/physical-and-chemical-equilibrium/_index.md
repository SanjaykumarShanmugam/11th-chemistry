Claude Louis Berthollet, a Savoyard-French chemist, studied the mechanism of reversible chemical reaction and developed the theory of chemical equilibria. He also contributed to modern chemical nomenclature. He was the first to demonstrate the bleaching action of chlorine gas, and developed a solution of sodium hypochlorite that acts as a bleaching agent.

**8.1 Introduction**

our daily life, we observe several chemical and changes. For example, a banana gets ripened days, silver gets tarnished in few months gets rusted slowly. These processes proceed rection. Now let us consider the transport of y hemoglobin in our body as an illustration ersible change. The hemoglobin combines en in lungs to form oxyhemoglobin. The oxy-

bin has a tendency to form hemoglobin by

releasing oxygen. In fact, in our lungs all the three species coexist.

Few chemical reactions proceed in only one direction whereas many reactions proceed in both the directions and these reactions are called reversible reactions.

In chemical reactions, the concentration of the reactants decreases and that of the products increases with time. In reversible reactions, initially the reaction proceeds towards the formation of the product. Upon formation of the product, the reverse reaction begins to take place. At a particular stage, the rate of the reverse reaction is equal to that of the forward reaction indicating a state of equilibrium.

It is desirable to know the three crucial aspects of chemical reactions namely the feasibility, the rate of the reaction and the extent of reaction. We know that the feasibility of a reaction is given by thermodynamics. Chemical kinetics will tell about the rate of the reaction. The equilibrium constant tells about the extent of a reaction which we will discuss in this chapter. We will also discuss the types of equilibrium, the significance of equilibrium constant and its relationship to thermodynamic quantities and the response of chemical equilibrium to change in the reaction conditions.

**8.2. Physical and chemical equilibrium:**

There are different types of equilibrium. For example, if two persons with same weight sit on opposite sides of a see-saw at equal distance from the fulcrum, then the see-saw will be stationary and straight and it is said to be in equilibrium.  

**_Fig. 8.1 Illustration of equilibrium_**

Another example of a state of equilibrium is the game of "tug-of-war." In this game a rope is pulled taut between two teams. There may be a situation when both the teams are pulling the rope with equal force and the rope is not moving in either direction. This state is said to be in equilibrium.

**_Fig. 8.2.Tug-of War_**

In reversible processes, the rate of two opposing reactions equals at a particular stage. At this stage the concentration of reactants and products do not change with time. This condition is not static and is dynamic, because both the forward and reverse reactions are still occurring with the same rate.




  

**8.2.1 Physical equilibrium**

A system in which the amount of matter constituting different phases does not change with time is said to be in physical equilibrium. This involves no perceptible physical change in the system. To understand the physical equilibrium let us analyse the following phase changes.

**Solid-liquid equilibrium**

Let us consider the melting of ice in a closed container at 273 K. This system will reach a state of physical equilibrium in which the amount of water in the solid phase and liquid phase does not change with time. In the process the total number of water molecules leaving from and returning to the solid phase at any instant are equal.

If some ice-cubes and water are placed in a thermos flask (at 273K and 1 atm pressure), then there will be no change in the mass of ice and water.

At equilibrium,

Rate of melting of ice

\= Rate of freezing of water

H2O (s) ⇌ H2O (l)

The above equilibrium exists only at a particular temperature and pressure. The temperature at which the solid and liquid phases of a substance are at equilibrium is called the melting point or freezing point of that substance.

**Liquid - Vapour equilibrium**

Similarly, there exists an equilibrium  

between the liquid phase and the vapour phase of a substance. For example, liquid water is in equilibrium with its vapour at 373 K and1 atm pressure in a closed vessel.

H2O (l) ⇌ H2O (g)

Here Rate of evaporation = Rate of condensation

The temperature at which the liquid and vapour phases of a substance are at equilibrium is called the boiling point and condensation point of that substance.

**Solid - Vapour equilibrium**

Consider a closed system in which the solid sublimes to vapour. In this process also, equilibrium can be established between these two phases. When solid iodine is placed in a closed transparent vessel, after sometime,the vessel gets filled up with violet vapour due to sublimation of iodine. Initially, the intensity of the violet colour increases, after sometime it decreases and finally it becomes constant, as the following equilibrium is attained.

I2 (s) ⇌ I2(g)

**More examples**

Camphor (s) ⇌ Camphor (g)

NH4Cl (s) ⇌ NH4 Cl (g)

**8.2.2 Equilibrium involving dissolution of solids or gases in liquids**

**Solid in liquids**

When you add sugar to water at a particular temperature, it dissolves to form sugar solution. If you continue to




  

add much sugar, you will reach a stage at which the added sugar remains as solid and the resulting solution is called a saturated solution. Here, as in the previous cases a dynamic equilibrium is established between the solute molecules in the solid phase and in the solution phase.

Sugar (Solid) ⇌ Sugar (Solution)

In this process

Rate of dissolution of solute

\= Rate of

crystallisation of solute

**Gas in liquids**

When a gas dissolves in a liquid under a given pressure, there will be an equilibrium between gas molecules in the gaseous state and those dissolved in the liquid.

**Example:**

In carbonated beverages the following equilibrium exists.

CO2 (g) ⇌ CO2 (Solution)

Henry’s law is used to explain such gas-solution equilibrium processes.

**8.3. Chemical Equilibrium**

Similar to physical processes chemical reactions gradually attain a state of equilibrium after sometime. Let us consider a general reversible reaction.

A+B ⇌ C+D

Initially only A and B are present.  

Soon, a few molecules of the products C and D are formed by the forward reaction. As the concentration of the products increases, more products collide and react in the backward direction. This leads to an increase in the rate of backward reaction. As the rate of reverse reaction increases, the rate of the forward reaction decreases. Eventually, the rate of both reactions becomes equal.

Figure: 8.3 Attainment of equilibrium state for the variation of the rates of forward and

backward reactions with time.

**8.4. Dynamic nature of equilibrium:**

Let us consider, a situation in multi storey building, people are moving from first floor to second floor and vice versa. Assume that a certain number people moves up from first floor to second floor in a specific time, and the same number of people moves down from second floor to the first floor in the same time. Now, the rate of movement of people from first to second floor equals the




  

rate of movement of people from second to first floor, and hence the number of people in each floor will remain the same. Thus the population of people on the two floors is in a dynamic equilibrium Let us extend this analogy to understand dynamic nature of equilibrium.

Chemical reactions which are reversible do not cease, when equilibrium is attained. At equilibrium the forward and the backward reactions are proceeding at the same rate and no macroscopic change is observed. So chemical equilibrium is in a state of dynamic equilibrium.

For example,

H2 (g) + I2 (g) ⇌ 2HI (g)

**8.5 Homogeneous and heterogeneous equilibria**

8.5.1 Homogeneous equilibrium

In a homogeneous equilibrium, all the reactants and products are in the same phase.

For example:

H2 (g) + I2 (g) ⇌ 2HI (g)

In the above equilibrium, H2, I2 and HI are in the gaseous state.

Similarly, for the following reaction, all the reactants and products are in homogeneous solution phase.  

CH3COOCH3(aq)+H2O(aq)

⇌

CH3COOH(aq)+CH3OH (aq)

8.5.2 Heterogeneous equilibrium

If the reactants and products of a reaction in equilibrium, are in different phases, then it is called as heterogeneous equilibrium.

Example:

H2O (l) ⇌ H2O (g)

CaCO3 (s) ⇌ CaO (s) + CO2 (g)

**8.6 Law of mass action**

In 1864 two Norwegian chemists namely Maximilian Guldberg and Peter Waage formulated the law of mass action, based on the experimental studies of many reversible reactions. The law states that,

“At any instant, the rate of a chemical reaction at a given temperature is directly proportional to the product of the active masses of the reactants at that instant”.

Rate α \[Reactant\]x

where, x is the stoichiometric coefficient of the reactant and the square bracket represents the active mass (concentration) of the reactants.

Active mass = n V

  

   mol dm-3(or) mol L-1




  

where n is the number of moles and V is the volume of the container (dm3 or L)

8.6.1 Equilibrium constants (Kp and Kc):

Let us consider a reversible reaction,

_x_A+yB ⇌ _l_C + _m_D

where, A and B are the reactants, C and D are the products and x,y,_l_ and m are the stoichiometric coefficients of A, B, C and D, respectively.

Applying the law of mass action, the rate of the forward reaction,

rf α \[A\]x \[B\]y (or) rf = kf \[A\]x \[B\]y

Similarly, the rate of the backward reaction,

rb α \[C\]_l_ \[D\]m

rb = kb \[C\]_l_\[D\]m

where kf and kb are proportionality constants

At equilibrium,

Rate of forward reaction (rf)

kf \[A\]_x_ \[B\]y = kb \[C\]_l_ \[D\]m

or kf

kb

\[C\]_l_ \[D\]_m_

\[A\]_x_ \[B\]_y_ Kc= =

where, Kc is the equilibrium constant in terms of concentration (active mass).  

At a given temperature, the ratio of the product of active masses of reaction products raised to the respective stoichiometric coefficients in the balanced chemical equation to that of the reactants is a constant, known as equilibrium constant. Later when we study chemical kinetics we will learn that this is only approximately true.

If the reactants and products of the above reaction are in gas phase, then the equilibrium constant can be written in terms of partial pressures as indicated below,

Kp

pC _l_ × pD

_m_ =

pA _x_ × pB

_y_

Where, pA, pB, pC,and pD are the partial pressures of the gas A, B, C and D, respectively.

8.6.2 Relation between Kp and Kc

Let us consider the general reaction in which all reactants and products are ideal gases.

_x_A+_y_B ⇌ _l_C +_m_D

The equilibrium constant, Kc is

Kc

\[C\]_l_ \[D\]_m_

\[A\]_x_ \[B\]_y_ \= (1)

and Kp is,

Kp

pC _l_ × pD

_m_ =

pA _x_ × pB

_y_ (2)

The ideal gas equation is




  

PV nRT or

P n V

RT

\=

\=

Since

Active mass = molar concentration = n/V P = active mass × (RT)

Based on the above expression the partial pressure of the reactants and products can be expressed as,

pA _x_ = \[A\]_x_ (RT)_x_

pB _y_ = \[B\]_y_ (RT)_y_

pC _1_ \= \[C\]_l_ (RT)_l_

pD _m_ \= \[D\]_m_ (RT)_m_

On substitution in Eqn. 2,

Kp

\[C\]_l_ \[RT\]_l_ \[D\]_m_ (RT)_m_

Kp

\[C\]_l_ \[D\]_m_

\= \[A\]_x_ \[B\]_y_ (RT)(_l+m) - (x+y)_

By comparing equation (1) and (4), we get

Kp = Kc (RT)Δng (5)

where, Δng is the difference between the sum of number of moles of products and the sum of number of moles of reactants in the gas phase.  

The following relations become immediately obvious.

When Δng = 0

Kp = Kc (RT)0

**Kp = Kc**

**Examples:**

**1\.** H2(g) + I2(g) ⇌ 2HI (g)

**2\.** N2 (g) +O2 (g) ⇌ 2NO(g)

When Δng = +ve

Kp = Kc (_RT_)+ve

**Kp>Kc**

**Examples:**

**1\.** 2NH3(g) ⇌ N2 (g) + 3H2 (g)

**2\.** PCI5 (g) ⇌ PCl3 (g) + Cl2 (g)

When Δng = -ve

Kp = Kc (RT)-ve

**Kp< Kc**

**Examples:**

**1\.** 2H2(g) + O2(g) ⇌ 2H2O (g)

**2\.** 2SO2(g) + O2(g) ⇌ 2SO3 (g)

8.7.2 Predicting the direction of a reaction

From the knowledge of equilibrium constant, it is possible to predict the direction in which the net reaction is taking place for a given concentration or partial pressure of reactants and products.

Consider a general homogeneous reversible reaction,

_x_A + _y_B ⇌ _l_C + _m_D

For the above reaction under non- equilibrium conditions, reaction quotient ‘Q’ is defined as the ratio of the product of active masses of reaction products raised to the respective stoichiometric coefficients in the balanced chemical equation to that of the reactants.

Under non-equilibrium conditions, the reaction quotient Q can be calculated using the following expression.

Q C D A

m

\= \[ \] \[ \] \[ \] \[B\]x y

_l_

As the reaction proceeds, there is a continuous change in the concentration of  

reactants and products and also the Q value until the reaction reaches the equilibrium. At equilibrium Q is equal to Kc at a particular temperature. Once the equilibrium is attained, there is no change in the Q value. By knowing the Q value, we can predict the direction of the reaction by comparing it with Kc.

• If Q = Kc, the reaction is in equilibrium state.

• If Q > Kc, the reaction will proceed in the reverse direction i.e., formation of reactants.

• If Q < Kc, the reaction will proceed in the forward direction i.e., formation of products.

At a particular instant, the concentration of H2, I2and HI are found to be 0.2 mol L-1, 0.2 mol L-1 and 0.6 mol L-1 respectively. From the above information we can predict the direction of reaction as follows.

**8.8 Le-Chatelier's Principle**

Many chemical reactions that have industrial importance such as synthesis of ammonia are reversible in nature. It is important to know the reaction conditions to produce maximum yield. If a system at equilibrium is disturbed by modifying the reaction conditions, then the system adjusts itself the new conditions to re-establish the equilibrium.

The effect of change in reaction conditions such as temperature, pressure and concentration etc. on a system at equilibrium can be predicted by Le Chatelier-Braun principle.






| A |B |C |D |
|------|------|------|------|------|
| Initial concentration |1 |1 |1 |1 |
| At equilibrium (as per reaction stoichiometr y) |1-x |1-x |1+x |1+x |
  

It states that “If a system at equilibrium is disturbed, then the system shifts itself in a direction that nullifies the effect of that disturbance.”

**8.8. 1 Effect of concentration**

At equilibrium, the concentration of the reactants and the products does not change. The addition of more reactants or products to the reacting system at equilibrium causes an increase in their respective concentrations.

According to Le Chatelier’s principle, the effect of increase in concentration of a substance is to shift the equilibrium in a direction that consumes the added substance.

Let us consider the reaction

H2(g) + I2(g) ⇌ 2HI(g)

The addition of H2 or I2 to the equilibrium mixture, disturbs the equilibrium. In order to minimize the stress, the system shifts the reaction in a direction where H2and I2 are consumed. i.e., the formation of additional HI would balance the effect of added reactant. Hence, the equilibrium shifts to the right (forward direction) i.e. the forward reaction takes place until the equilibrium is re-established. Similarly, removal of HI (product) also favours the forward reaction.

If HI is added to the equilibrium mixture, the concentration HI is increased, and system proceeds in the reverse direction to nullify the effect of increase in concentration of HI .  

Let us explain the effect change in concentration by considering the formation of HI from H2 and I2. At equilibrium, the concentrations of HI, H2 and I2 are 1 M, 0.2 M and 0.1 M respectively.

The equilibrium was disturbed by adding 0.1 M iodine to the reaction mixture. After sometime, the concentration of HI is found to be 1.092 M. Let us verify whether the system proceeds to re-establish the equilibrium according to Le Chatelier’s principle.

Now,

Concentration of HI = 1+2x = 1.092 M

2x = 0.092

x = 0.046 M

Therefore, the concentration of hydrogen and iodine at this stage,

\[H2\] = 0.2 – X = 0.2 -0.046 = 0.154

\[I2\] = 0.2 – X = 0.2 -0.046 = 0.154

Let the system be allowed to attain equilibrium in a cylinder with a piston. If we press the piston down to increase the pressure, the volume decreases. The system responds to this effect by reducing the number of gas molecules. i.e. it favours the formation of ammonia. If we pull the piston upwards to reduce the pressure, the volume increases. It favours the decomposition of ammonia

N2 H2 NH3

**_Figure 8.6 Effect of pressure on ammonia synthesis._**

However, when the total number of the moles of the gaseous reactants and the gaseous products are equal, the change in pressure has no effect on system at equilibrium.

Let us consider the following reaction

H2(g) + I2 (g) ⇌ 2HI(g)

2 moles of reactants ⇒ 2 moles of products

Here, the number of moles of reactants and products are equal. So, the pressure has no effect on such equilibrium with Δng = 0.  

**8.8.3 Effect of temperature**

If the temperature of a system at equilibrium is changed, the system responds by shifting the equilibrium in the direction that attempts to nullify the effect of temperature.

Let us consider the formation of ammonia.

In this equilibrium, the forward reaction is exothermic i.e. heat is liberated while the reverse reaction is endothermic i.e. heat is absorbed.

If the temperature of the system is increased (by supplying heat energy), the system responds by decomposing some of the ammonia molecules to nitrogen and hydrogen by absorbing the supplied heat energy. Similarly, the system responds to a drop in the temperature by forming more ammonia molecules from nitrogen and hydrogen, which releases heat energy.

We have already learnt that the change in pressure or concentration causes a change in the equilibrium concentration such that the equilibrium constant remains the same. However, in case of change in temperature, the equilibrium is reestablished with a different equilibrium constant.

**8.8.4 Effect of a catalyst**

Addition of a catalyst does not affect the state of the equilibrium. The catalyst increases the rate of both the forward and the reverse reactions to the same extent. Hence, it does not change the equilibrium composition of the reaction mixture.




  

However, it speeds up the attainment of equili lower activation energy. For example, in the synthesis of NH3 by Similarly, in the contact process of manufacturi

**8.8.5 Effect of inert gas** When an inert gas (i.e, a gas which doe equilibrium) is added to an equilibrium system of gases present in the container increases, tha partial pressure of the reactants and the produc addition of inert gas has no effect on equilibrium

Chemical Equilibrium

• Chemical reactions which are reversible do not cease, when equilibrium is attained. At equilibrium the forward and the backward reactions are proceeding at the same rate and no macroscopic change is observed. So chemical equilibrium is in a state of dynamic equilibrium.

• The rate law states that, “At any instant, the rate of a chemical reaction at a given temperature is directly proportional to the product of the active masses of the reactants at that instant”.

• The value of equilibrium constant, Kc tells us the extent of a reaction, i.e., it indicates how far the reaction has proceeded towards product formation at a given temperature.

• Under non-equilibrium conditions, reaction quotient ‘Q’ is defined as the ratio of the product of active masses of reaction products raised to the respective stoichiometric coefficients in the balanced chemical equation to that of the reactants.
