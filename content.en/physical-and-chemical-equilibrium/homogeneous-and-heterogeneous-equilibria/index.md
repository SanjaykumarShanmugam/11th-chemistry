8.5.1 Homogeneous equilibrium

In a homogeneous equilibrium, all the reactants and products are in the same phase.

For example:


|H<sub>2</sub> (g) + I<sub>2</sub> (g) ⇌ 2HI (g)|
|---------------|


In the above equilibrium, H2, I2 and HI are in the gaseous state.

Similarly, for the following reaction, all the reactants and products are in homogeneous solution phase.  

|CH <sub>3</sub>COOCH<sub>3</sub>(aq)+H<sub>2</sub>O(aq) ⇌ CH<sub>3</sub>COOH(aq)+CH<sub>3</sub>OH (aq)|
|---------------|

8.5.2 Heterogeneous equilibrium

If the reactants and products of a reaction in equilibrium, are in different phases, then it is called as heterogeneous equilibrium.

Example:

H<sub>2</sub>>O (l) ⇌ H<sub>2</sub>O (g)
|---------------|
CaCO<sub>3</sub> (s) ⇌ CaO (s) + CO<sub>2</sub> (g)
