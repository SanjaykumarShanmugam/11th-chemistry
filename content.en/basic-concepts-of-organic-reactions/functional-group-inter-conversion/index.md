 Functional Group inter conversion

Organic synthesis involves functional group inter conversions. A particular functional group can be converted into other functional group by reacting it with suitable reagents. For example: The carboxylic acid group (–COOH) presents in organic acids can be transformed to a variety of other functional group such as – CH<sub>2</sub>–OH, – CONH<sub>2</sub>, – COCl by treating the acid with LiAlH<sub>4</sub>, NH<sub>3</sub> and SOCl<sub>2</sub> respectively.
