**Otto diels and kurt alder** describes an important reaction mechanism for the reaction between a conjucated diene and a substituted alkene. For this work they were awarded nobel prize in chemistry in 1950 Diels - Alder reaction isa powerful tool in synthetic organic chemistry.

**12.1 Intro**

A chemical reaction can be treated as the reacting molecules are broken and new bo a reactant is converted into a product. This c general an organic reaction can be represente

_Substrate + Reagent \[Intermediate sta_

Here the substrate is an organic molecule whi which may be an organic, inorganic or any ag the chemical change

Many chemical reactions are depicted in one or an energy barrier, leading to the formation states. The series of simple steps which collec substrate to product is called as the mechani  

**ng Objectives**

rning this unit, students will be able to

stand the concept of organic reaction anism

ibe homolytic and heterolytic fission of bonds

fy free radicals, nucleophiles and electrophiles,

fy organic reactions into substitution, ation, addition, oxidation and reduction

ibe electron movement in organic reactions

in the electronic effects in co-valent bonds

**duction**

a process by which some existing bonds in nds are formed. i.e., in a chemical reaction, onversion involves one or more steps. A In d as

more simple steps. Each step passes through of short lived intermediates or transition tively represent the chemical change, from sm of the reaction. The slowest step in the




  

mechanism determines the overall rate of the reaction.
