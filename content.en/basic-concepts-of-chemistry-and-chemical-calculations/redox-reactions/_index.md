When an apple is cut, it turns brown after sometime. Do you know the reason behind this colour change? It is because of a chemical reaction called oxidation. We come across oxidation reactions in our daily life. For example 1) burning of LPG gas 2) rusting of iron

**Fig. 1.4 Oxidation reactions in daily life**

Even a small amount of oxygen present in air leads to the rusting of iron, i.e. iron is oxidised to Fe3+.

But the Fe2+ present in haemoglobin which binds oxygen during transport of oxygen from lungs to tissues never gets oxidised. Do you know why?

The answer lies in the structural features of haemoglobin. Haemoglobin contains four sub units each with a porphyrin ring (heme) attached to the protein (globin) molecule. In this structure, the iron (Fe2+) forms a co-ordination complex with an octahedral geometry. The four positions of the octahedron are occupied by porphyrin rings, fifth position is filled by imidazole ring of a histidine residue and the sixth position is utilized for binding the oxygen molecule. Generally the Fe2+ in heme is susceptible to oxidation. Since the Fe2+ ion in haemoglobin is surrounded by the globin protein chain that provides a hydrophobic environment, the oxidation of Fe2+ becomes difficult. However, 3% of haemoglobin is oxidised to methemoglobin (haemoglobin where the iron is present in Fe3+ state and oxygen does not bind to this) daily. The enzyme methemoglobin reductase reduces it back to haemoglobin.

3) Oxidation of carbohydrates, lipids, etc. into CO2 and H2O to produce energy in the living organisms.

All oxidation reactions are accompanied by reduction reactions and vice versa. Such reactions are called redox reactions. As per the classical concept, addition of oxygen (or) removal of hydrogen is called oxidation and the reverse is called reduction.

**Cyanide poisoning**: While oxygen binds reversibly to haemoglobin, cyanide binds irreversibly to haemoglobin and blocks oxygen binding. As a result the transport of oxygen from the lungs to tissues is stopped. It leads to the quick death of the person.

Consider the following two reactions.

Reaction 1 : 4 Fe + 3O2 → 2 Fe2O3

Reaction 2 : H2S + Cl2 → 2 HCl + S

Both these reactions are oxidation reactions as per the classical concept.

In the first reaction which is responsible for the rusting of iron, the oxygen adds on to the metal, iron. In the second reaction, hydrogen is removed from Hydrogen sulphide (H2S). Identity which species gets reduced.

Consider the following two reactions in which the removal of oxygen and addition of hydrogen take place respectively. These reactions are called reduction reactions as per the classical concept.

CuO + C → Cu + CO (Removal of oxygen from cupric oxide)

S + H2 → H2S (Addition of hydrogen to sulphur).

Oxidation-reduction reactions i.e. redox reactions are not always associated with oxygen or hydrogen. In such cases, the process can be explained on the basis of electrons. The reaction involving loss of electron is termed oxidation and gain of electron is termed reduction.

**For example,**

Fe2+ → Fe3+ + e– (loss of electron-oxidation).

Cu2++ 2e– → Cu (gain of electron-reduction)

Redox reactions can be better explained using oxidation numbers.  

**1.8.1 Oxidation Number:**

It is defined as the imaginary charge left on the atom when all other atoms of the compound have been removed in their usual oxidation states that are assigned according to set of rules. A term that is often used interchangeably with oxidation number is oxidation state

1) The oxidation state of a free element (i.e. in its uncombined state) is zero.

**Example :** each atom in H2, Cl2, Na, S8 have the oxidation number of zero.

2) For a monatomic ion, the oxidation state is equal to the net charge on the ion.

**Example : The oxidation number of sodium** in Na+ is +1.

The oxidation number of chlorine in Cl– is –1.

3) The algebric sum of oxidation states of all atoms in a molecule is equal to zero, while in ions, it is equal to the net charge on the ion.

**Example:**

In H2SO4 ; 2 × (oxidation number of hydrogen) + (oxidation number of S) + 4 (oxidation number of oxygen) = 0.

In SO4 2– ; (oxidation number of S) + 4

(oxidation number of oxygen) = –2.

4) Hydrogen has an oxidation number of +1 in all its compounds except in metal hydrides where it has –1 value.




  

**Example:**

Oxidation number of hydrogen in hydro

Oxidation number of hydrogen in sodium

5) Fluorine has an oxidation state of – 1 in

6) The oxidation state of oxygen in most c super oxides and compounds with fluori

i) in water (H2O) is –2.

ii) in hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is –1.

iii) in super oxides such as KO2 is – 1 2

+1 + 2x = 0 ; 2x = – 1 ;

iv) in oxygen difluoride (OF2) is + 2.

x + 2 (–1) = 0; x = + 2

**Redox reactions in terms of oxidation numb**

During redox reactions, the oxidation which oxidation number of the element incre it decreases is called reduction.

Consider the following reaction

2 KMnO4 + 10FeSO4 + 8H2SO4 K + 7 + 2

oxidation number increase

oxidation number d reduction

In this reaction, manganese in potas oxidation of ferrous sulphate (FeSO4) into fer and thereby gets reduced. Such reagents are c , the reagents which facilitate reduction by re reducing agents.

**3\. Displacement reactions:**

Redox reactions in which an ion (or an atom) in a compound is replaced by an ion (or atom) of another element are called displacement reactions. They are further classified into (i) metal displacement reactions (ii) non-metal displacement reactions.

**(i) Metal displacement reactions:**

Place a zinc metal strip in an aqueous copper sulphate solution taken in a beaker. Observe the solution, the intensity of blue colour of the solution slowly reduced and finally disappeared.

The zinc metal strip became coated with brownish metallic copper. This is due to the following metal displacement reaction.

**4\. Disproportionation reaction (Auto redox reactions)**

In some redox reactions, the same compound can undergo both oxidation and reduction. In such reactions, the oxidation state of one and the same element is both increased and decreased. These reactions are called disproportionation reactions.

**Examples:**

**5\. Competitive electron transfer reaction**

In metal displacement reactions, we learnt that zinc replaces copper from copper sulphate solution. Let us examine whether the reverse reaction takes place or not. As discussed earlier, place a metallic copper strip in zinc sulphate solution. If copper replaces zinc from zinc sulphate solution, Cu2+ ions would be released into the solution and the colour of the solution




  

would change to blue. But no such change is observed. Therefore, we conclude that among zinc and copper, zinc has more tendency to release electrons and copper to accept the electrons.

Let us extend the reaction to copper metal and silver nitrate solution. Place a strip of metallic copper in sliver nitrate solution taken in a beaker. After some time, the solution slowly turns blue. This is due to the formation of Cu2+ ions, i.e. copper replaces silver from silver nitrate. The reaction is,

Cu(s) + 2AgNO3 (aq) Cu(NO3)2 (aq) +2Ag (s) +20 0+1

Oxidation

Reduction

It indicates that between copper and silver, copper has the tendency to release electrons and silver to accept electrons.

From the above experimental observations, we can conclude that among the three metals, namely, zinc, copper and silver, the electron releasing tendency is in the following order.

**Zinc > Copper > Silver**  

This kind of competition for electrons among various metals helps us to design (galvanic) cells. In XII standard we will study the galvanic cell in detail.

**1.8.3. Balancing (the Equation) of Redox Reactions**

The two methods for balancing the equation of redox reactions are as follows.

i) The oxidation number method

ii) Ion-electron method / half reaction method.

Both are based on the same principle: In oxidation - reduction reactions the total number of electrons donated by the reducing agent is equal to the total number of electrons gained by the oxidising agent.

**Oxidation number method**

In this method, the number of electrons lost or gained in the reaction is calculated from the oxidation numbers of elements before and after the reaction. Let us consider the oxidation of ferrous sulphate by potassium permanganate in acid medium. The unbalanced chemical equation is,

FeSO4 + KMnO4+H2SO4→Fe2(SO4)3 +

MnSO4+ K2SO4+H2O

**Step 1**

Using oxidation number concept, identify the reactants (atom) which undergo oxidation and reduction.




  

FeSO4 + KMnO4+H2SO4→Fe2 (SO4)3 +2 +7 +3

Reduction

Oxidation

\+ MnSO4+ K2SO4+H2O +2

a) The oxidation number of Mn in KMnO4 changes from +7 to +2 by gaining five electrons.

b) The oxidation number of Fe in FeSO4 changes from +2 to +3 by loosing one electron.

**Step 2**

Since, the total number of electrons lost is equal to the total number of electrons gained, equate, the number of electrons, by cross multiplication of the respective formula with suitable integers on reactant side as below. Here, the product Fe2(SO4)3 contains 2 moles of iron, So, the Coefficients 1e- & 5e- are multiplied by the number '2'

FeSO4 + KMnO4+H2SO4→ Fe2(SO4)3 +2 +7 +3

5e- × 21e- × 2

102

\+ MnSO4

\+ K2SO4+H2O

+2

10 FeSO4+2 KMnO4+H2SO4 → Fe2(SO4)3 +

MnSO4 + K2SO4 + H2O

**Step 3 Balance the reactant / Product - Oxidised / reduced**

Now, based on the reactant side, balance the products (ie oxidised and reduced).The above equation becomes  

10FeSO4+2KMnO4+H2SO4 → 5Fe2(SO4)3 + 2MnSO4 + K2SO4 + H2O

**Step 4** Balance the other elements except H and O atoms. In this case, we have to balance K and S atoms but K is balanced automatically.

Reactant Side : 10 'S' atoms (10 FeSO4)

Product Side : 18 'S' atoms

5Fe2(SO4)3 + 2MnSO4 + K2SO4

15S 1S2S =+ + 18S

Therefore the difference 8-S atoms in reactant side, has to be balanced by multiplying H2SO4 by '8' The equation now becomes,

10FeSO4+2KMnO4+8H2SO4 →5Fe2(SO4)3

\+ 2MnSO4 + K2SO4 + H2O

**Step 5**

Balancing 'H' and 'O' atoms

Reactant side '16'-H atoms (8H2SO4 i.e. 8 x 2H = 16 'H')

Product side '2' - H atoms (H2O i.e. 1 x 2H = 2 'H')

Therefore, multiply H2O molecules in the product side by '8'

10 FeSO4+2 KMnO4+8 H2SO4 →

5 Fe2(SO4)3 + 2 MnSO4 + K2SO4 + 8H**2**O

The oxygen atom is automatically balanced. This is the balanced equation.

**Ion - Electron method** This method is used for ionic redox reactions. **Step 1** Using oxidation number concept, find out the reactants which undergo oxidation and reduction. **Step 2**

Write two separate half equations for oxidation and reduction reaction,

Let us consider the same example which we have already discussed in oxidation number method.

KMnO4 +FeSO4 + H2SO4 →

MnSO4+Fe2(SO4)3 + K2SO4+H2O

The ionic form of this reaction is,

8) Balance the following equation using o

As2S3 + HNO3 + H2O → H  

The two half reactions are,

Fe2+ → Fe3+ + 1e- ------------------------ (1) and

MnO− 4 + 5e- → Mn2+ -------------------- (2)

Balance the atoms and charges on both sides of the half reactions.

Equation (1)⇒ No changes i.e.,

Fe2+→ Fe3+ + 1e- ------------------------- (1)

Equation (2)⇒ 4'O' on the reactant side, therefore add 4H2O on the product side, to balance 'H' - add, 8H+ in the reactant side

MnO− 4 + 5e- + 8H+ → Mn2+ + 4H2O---- (3)

**Step 3**

Equate both half reactions such that the number of electrons lost is equal to number of electrons gained.

Addition of two half reactions gives the balanced equation represented by equation (6).
