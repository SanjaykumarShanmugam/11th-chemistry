Often we use special names to express the quantity of individual items for our convenience. For example, a dozen  

roses means 12 roses and one quire paper means 24 single sheets. We can extend this analogy to understand the concept of mole that is used for quantifying atoms and molecules in chemistry. Mole is the SI unit to represent a specific amount of a substance.

To understand the mole concept, let us calculate the total number of atoms present in 12 g of carbon -12 isotope or molecules in 158.03 g of potassium permanganate, 294.18 g of potassium dichromate and 180 g of glucose.

**Gastric acid and antacids:**

Antacids are commonly used medicines for treating heartburn and acidity. Do

you know the chemistry behind it?

Gastric acid is a digestive fluid formed in the stomach and it contains hydrochloric acid. The typical concentration of the acid in gastric acid is 0.082 M. When the concentration exceeds 0.1 M it causes the heartburn and acidity.

ce of a system, which contains as many 2 g of carbon-12 isotope. The elementary ons or any other specified particles.

Antacids used to treat acidity contain mostly magnesium hydroxide or aluminium hydroxide that neutralises the excess acid. The chemical reactions are as follows.

3 HCl + Al(OH)<sub>3</sub>→ AlCl<sub>3</sub> + 3 H<sub>2</sub>O

2 HCl + Mg(OH)<sub>2</sub>→MgCl<sub>2</sub> + 2 H<sub>2</sub>O

From the above reactions we know that 1 mole of aluminium hydroxide neutralises 3 moles of HCl while 1 mole of magnesium hydroxide neutralises 2 moles of HCl.


**1.4.1 Avogadro Number:**

The total number of entities present in one mole of any substance is equal to 6.022 x 10<sup>23</sup> . This number is called Avogadro number which is named after the Italian physicist Amedeo Avogadro who proposed that equal volume of all gases under the same conditions of temperature and pressure contain equal number of molecules. Avogadro number does not have any unit.

In a chemical reaction, atoms or molecules react in a specific ratio. Let us consider the following examples

Reaction 1 : C + O<sub>2</sub> → CO<sub>2</sub> 

Reaction 2 : CH<sub>4</sub>  + 2O<sub>2</sub>  → CO<sub>2</sub>  + 2 H<sub>2</sub>O In the first reaction, one carbon atom reacts with one oxygen molecule to give one carbon dioxide molecule. In the second reaction, one molecule of methane burns with two molecules of oxygen to give one molecule of carbon dioxide and two molecules of water. It is clear that the ratio of reactants is based on the number of molecules. Even though the ratio is based on the number of molecules it is practically difficult to count the number of

Let us calculate the amount of acid neutralised by an antacid that contains 250 mg of aluminium hydroxide and 250 mg of magnesium hydroxide.


Total no. of moles of OH- ion from one tablet 0.0182  

One tablet of above composition will neutralise 0.0182 mole of HCl for a person with gastric acid content of 0.1 mole. One tablet can be used to neutralize the excess acid which will bring the concentration back to normal level. (0.1 – 0.018 = 0.082 M)

Acidity & Heart burn

He is known for the Avogadro's hypothesis. In honour of his contributions, the number of fundamental particles in a mole of substance was named as Avogadro number. Though Avogadro didn't predict the number of particles in equal volumes of gas, his hypothesis did lead to the eventual determination of the number as 6.022 x 1023 Rudolf Clausius, with his kinetic theory of gases, provided evidence for Avogadro's law.

molecules. Because of this reason it is beneficial to use **'mole'** concept rather than the actual number of molecules to quantify the reactants and the products. We can explain the first reaction as one mole of carbon reacts with one mole of oxygen to give one mole of carbon dioxide and the second reaction as one mole of methane burns with two moles of oxygen to give one mole of carbon dioxide and two moles of water. When only atoms are involved, scientists also use the term one gram atom instead of one mole.

**1.4.2 Molar Mass:**

Molar mass is defined as the mass of one mole of a substance. The molar mass of a compound is equal to the sum of the relative atomic masses of its constituents expressed in g mol<sup> -1 <sup>.

**Examples:** • relative atomic mass of one hydrogen

atom = 1.008 u • molar mass of hydrogen atom

\= 1.008 g mol<sup> -1 <sup>

• relative molecular mass of glucose = 180 u

• molar mass of glucose = 180 g mol<sup> -1 <sup>

**1.4.3 Molar Volume:**

The volume occupied by one mole of any substance in the gaseous state at a given temperature and pressure is called molar volume.
