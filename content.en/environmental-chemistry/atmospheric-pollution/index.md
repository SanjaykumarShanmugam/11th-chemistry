Earth’s atmosphere is a layer of gases retained by the earth’s gravity. It contains roughly  78%  nitrogen,  21%  oxygen,
0.93% argon, 0.04% carbon dioxide, trace amounts of other gases and little amount of water vapour. This mixture is commonly known as air.
Earth’s atmosphere can be divided into different layers with characteristic altitude and temperature. The various regions of atmosphere are given in table 15.1.

**Table 1 Regions of atmosphere**
| Region                   | Altitude From | Temperature | Gases/Species           |
|--------------------------|---------------|-------------|-------------------------|
| Troposphere              | 0-10 km       | 15°C to -56°C| N2, O2, CO2, H2O (vap)  |
| Stratosphere (ozonosphere)| 10-50 km      | -56°C to -2°C| N2, O2, O3, O atoms     |
| Mesosphere               | 50-85 km      | -2°C to –92°C| N2, O, 2NO              |
| Thermosphere             | 85-500 km     | -92°C to 1200°C| O, O+, 2NO+, e–         |
 

**Troposphere :**

The lowest layer of the atmosphere is called the troposphere and it extends from 0 – 10 km from the earth surface. About 80% of the mass of the atmosphere is in this layer. This troposphere is further divided as follows.

**i) Hydrosphere:**

Hydrosphere includes all types of water sources like oceans, seas, rivers, lakes, streams, underground water, polar icecaps, clouds etc. It covers about 75% of the earth’s surface. Hence the earth is called as a blue planet.

**ii) Lithosphere:**

Lithosphere includes soil, rocks and mountains which are solid components of earth.

**iii) Biosphere:**

It includes the lithosphere hydrosphere and atmosphere intergrating  

the living organism present in the lithosphere, hydrosphere and atmosphere.

>**The Bhopal Tragedy**
>
>The world’s worst chemical disaster happened in the Indian city of Bhopal in the early morning hours of December 3, 1984.An explosion at the Union Carbide pesticide plant released a cloud of toxic gas (methyl isocyanate) CH3NCO into the air. Since the gas was twice as heavy as air, it did not drift away but formed a ‘blanket’ over the surrounding area. It attacked people’s lungs and affected their breathing. Thousands of people died and the lives of many were ruined. The lungs, brain, eyes, muscles as well as gastrointestinal, neurological and immune systems of those who survived were severely affected.
