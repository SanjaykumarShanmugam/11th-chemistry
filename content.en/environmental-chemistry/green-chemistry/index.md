Green chemistry is a chemical philosophy encouraging the design of products and processes that reduce or eliminate the use and generation of hazardous substances.


For this, scientist are trying to develop methods to produce eco-friendly compounds. This can be best understood by considering the following example in which styrene is produced both by traditional and greener routes.


**Traditional route**


This method involves two steps. Carcinogenic benzene reacts with ethylene to form ethyl benzene. Then ethyl benzene on dehydrogenation using Fe2O3/ Al2O3 gives styrene.


**Greener route**


To avoid carcinogenic benzene, greener route is to start with cheaper and environmentally safer xylenes.


# Green chemistry in day-to-day life


A few contribution of green chemistry in our day to day life is given below


**(1) Dry cleaning of clothes**


Solvents like tetrachloroethylene used in dry cleaning of clothes, pollute the ground water and are carcinogenic. In the place of tetrachloroethylene, liquefied CO<sub>2</sub> with suitable detergent, is an alternate solvent used. Liquified CO<sub>2</sub> is not harmful  


to the ground water. Now a days H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> used for bleaching clothes in laundry, gives better results and utilises less water.


**(2) Bleaching of paper**


Conventional method of bleaching was done with chlorine. Now a days H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>can be used for bleaching paper in presence of catalyst.


**(3) Synthesis of chemicals**


Acetaldehyde is now commercially prepared by one step oxidation of ethene in the presence of ionic catalyst in aqueous medium with 90% yield.


$\ce{CH2 = CH2 + O  ->[{Catalyst}][{Pd(II) /Cu (II)}] CH3CHO}$




**(4) Instead of petrol, methanol is used as a fuel in automobiles.**


**(5) Neem based pesticides have been synthesised, which are safer than the chlo- rinated hydrocarbons.**


Every individual has an important role for preventing pollution and improving our environment. We are responsible for environmental protection. Let us begin to save our environment and provide a clean earth for our future generations.


**SUMMARY**


Environmental chemistry plays a vital role in environment. Environmental chemistry means scientific study of chemical and bio chemical process occurring in environment. World Environmental Day is celebrated on fifth of June of every year.


**Environmental Pollution:**


Environmental pollution is the effect of undesirable changes in the surrounding that haveharmful effects on living things.


Pollutants are generally classified as rapidly degradable (e.g. discarded vegetables),slowly degradable(e.g. Agriculture waste) and non-bio degradable pollutants (e.g. DDT, plastic materials).


**Atmospheric pollution**


Atmospheric pollutions include tropospheric and stratospheric pollution. Troposphere and stratosphere greatly affect the biosphere of the earth due to which the study of pollutions in these regions is most important.


**Tropospheric pollution:**


Troposphere is the lowest region of atmosphere in which man, animal and plants exist. Gaseous pollutants like SO<sub>x</sub>,NO<sub>x</sub>,CO,CO<sub>2</sub>,O<sub>3</sub> hydrocarbons and particulate pollutants like dust, mist, fumes, smog cause pollutions in troposphere


**Acid rain:**


When the PH of rain water becomes lower than 5.6 it is called acid rain. Acid rain is a byproduct of various human activities that emit sulphuroxides and nitrogen oxides in atmosphere. It damages buildings, statues and other monuments..  


The acid rain in water reservoir like rivers, ponds adversely affects microbes ,aquatic plants and fishes.


**Greenhouse effect:**


The process of warming up of earth is known as greenhouse effect or global warming. CO<sub>2</sub>>, CH<sub>4</sub>, O<sub>3</sub>, CFC, N<sub>2</sub> and water vapour present in atmosphere act as a greenhouse gases. Heat retaining capacity of greenhouse gases are called Global Warming Potential (GWP).The GWP based sequence of greenhouse gases is as CFC>N<sub>2</sub>O>CH<sub>4</sub>>CO<sub>2</sub>.


**Stratospheric pollution:**


Stratosphere extends above troposphere up to 50Km above.


**Depletion of ozone layer:**


Ozone layer present in stratosphere protect the living species against harmful UV rays from space but Ozone Depletion Substance (ODS) used by humans deplete ozone layer. To create awareness in the Whole world, United Nations decided to celebrate 16th September of every year as “Ozone Layer Protection Day”.


**Water pollution**


Water is the elixir of life, but it is polluted by point and nonpoint sources.Institutions like World Health Organization (WHO) and Bureau of Indian standards (BIS) and Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) have prescribed standards for quality of drinking water.








 


**Soil pollution**


Lithosphere with humus cover is known as soil. The topsoil provides water and all nutrients required by plants for their growth. Industrial waste, artificial fertilisers and pesticides result in soil pollution.


**Waste management**


The strategies for controlling environmental pollution are called can be waste management.Waste management involves reduction and proper disposal of waste. Wastes are produced in three forms, solid, liquid and gase. Solid waste can be disposed by segregation, dumping, incineration and composting.


**Green chemistry**


Efforts to control environmental pollution resulted in development of science for synthesis of chemicals favorable to environment which is called green chemistry.Green chemistry means science of environmentally favorable chemical synthesis.
