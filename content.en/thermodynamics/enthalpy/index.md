**7.5 Enthalpy (H)**

The enthalpy (H), is a thermodynamic property of a system, is defined as the sum of the internal energy (_U_) of a system and the product of pressure and volume of the system. That is,

H = U + PV –––––––––––––––––(7.8)

It reflects the capacity to do mechanical work and the capacity to release heat by the system. When a process occurs at constant pressure, the heat involved (either released or absorbed) is equal to the change in enthalpy.

Enthalpy is a state function which depends entirely on the state functions T, P and U. Enthalpy is usually expressed as the change in enthalpy (ΔH) for a process between initial and final states at constant pressure.

ΔH = ΔU + PΔV ––––––––––––––––(7.9)

The change in enthalpy (Δ_H)_ is equal to the heat supplied at the constant pressure to a system (as long as the system does no additional work).

ΔH=q<sub>p</sub>

In an endothermic reaction heat is absorbed by the system from the surroundings that is _q_\>0 (positive). Therefore, ΔH is also positive. In an exothermic reaction heat is evolved by the system to the surroundings that is, q<0 (negative). If q is negative, then ΔH will also be negative.  

**7.5.1 Relation between enthalpy \`H' and internal energy \`U'**

When the system at constant pressure undergoes changes from an initial state with H1, U1 and V1 to a final state with H2, U2 and V2 the change in enthalpy ΔH, can be calculated as follows:
{{<katex display>}}
H=U + PV\newline

In the initial state \newline

H_1=U_1 + PV_1−−−−−(7.10)\newline

In the final state\newline

H_2 = U_2 + PV_2−−−−(7.11)\newline

change in enthalpy is (7.11) - (7.10)\newline

(H_2−H_1) = (U_2−U_1) + P(V_2−V_1)\newline

ΔH=ΔU + PΔV --------- (7.12)\newline

As\ per first law of thermodynamics,\newline

ΔU = q+w\newline

Equation 7.12 becomes\newline

ΔH = q + w + PΔV\newline

w = -PΔV\newline

ΔH = q_p - PΔV + PΔV\newline

ΔH = q_p–––––––––– (7.13)\newline

qp− is the heat absorbed at constant pressure and is considered as heat content.

Consider a closed system of gases which are chemically reacting to form gaseous products at constant temperature




  

and pressure with V_i_ and V_f_ as the total volumes of the reactant and product gases respectively, and n_i_ and n_f_ as the number of moles of gaseous reactants and products, then,

For reactants (initial state) :

PVi = ni RT --------- (7.14)

For products (final state) :

PVf = nf RT --------- (7.15)

(7.15) - (7.14)

P (Vf -Vi) = (nf - ni) RT

P ΔV= Δn(g) RT –––––––(7.16)

Substituting in 7.16 in 7.12

ΔH = ΔU +Δn(g) RT–––––––(7.17)

**7.5.2 Enthalpy Changes for Different Types of Reactions and Phase Transitions:**

The heat or enthalpy changes accompanying chemical reactions is expressed in different ways depending on the nature of the reaction. These are discussed below.

**Standard heat of formation**

The standard heat of formation of a compound is defined as “the change in enthalpy that takes place when one mole of a compound is formed from its elements, present in their standard states (298 K and 1 bar pressure)". By convention the standard heat of formation of all elements is assigned a value of zero.  

Fe(s)+ S(s) → FeS(s)

ΔH<sub>f</sub><sup>0</sup> = – 100.42 kJ mol−1

2C(s)+H2(g)→ C2H2(g)

ΔH<sub>f</sub><sup>0</sup> = + 222.33 kJ mol−1

The standard heats of formation of some compounds are given in Table 7.4.
