**7.12 Third law of Thermodynamics**

The entropy of a substance varies directly with temperature. Lower the temperature, lower is the entropy. For example, water above 100⁰ C at one atmosphere exists as a gas and has higher entropy (higher disorder). The water molecules are free to roam about in the entire container. When the system is cooled, the water vapour condenses to form a liquid. The water molecules in liquid phase still can move about somewhat freely. Thus the entropy of the system has decreased. On further cooling, water freezes to form ice crystal. The water molecules in the ice crystal are highly ordered and entropy of the system is very low.

If we cool the solid crystal still further, the vibration of molecules held in the crystal lattice gets slower and they have very little freedom of movement (very little disorder) and hence very small entropy.

At absolute zero {0 K (or) − 2730C}, theoretically all modes of motion stop.




  

Absolute zero is a temperature that an object will remain unattainable.

Thus the third law of thermodynamic substance at absolute zero is zero. Otherwise the temperature of an object to absolute zero
