**10.8 Orbita**

When atoms combines to form a covalent atoms overlap to form a covalent bond. The bon region of the orbitals. Depending upon the n bonding between the two atoms as sigma (σ) an

**10.8.1 Sigma and Pi bonds**

When two atomic orbitals overlap linear a sigma (σ) bond. This overlap is also called involves an s orbital (s-s and s-p overlaps) will is spherical. Overlap between two p orbitals alo bond formation. When we consider x-axis as m σ-bond.

When two atomic orbitals overlaps sidew (π)bond. When we consider x-axis as molecular the formation of a π-bond.

Following examples will be useful to understand
