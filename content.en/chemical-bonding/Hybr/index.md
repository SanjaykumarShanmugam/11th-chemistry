In BeCl2 both the Be-Cl bonds are equivalent and it was observed that the molecule is linear. VB theory explain this observed behaviour by sp hybridisation. One of the paired electrons in the 2s orbital gets excited to 2p orbital and the electronic configuration at the excited state is shown.

Now, the 2s and 2p orbitals hybridise and produce two equivalent sp hybridised orbitals which have 50 % s-character and 50 % p-character. These sp hybridised orbitals are oriented in opposite direction as shown in the figure.
