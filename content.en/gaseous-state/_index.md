**GASEOUS STATE**

Jacques Charles (1746-1823)

So many properties of properties of matter, especially when in gaseous form, can be deduced from hypothesis that their minute parts are in rapid motion, the velocity increasing with temperature, that the precise nature of this motion becomes a subject of rational curiosity.

James Clerk Maxwell
