# 6.4 Mixture of gases - Dalton’s law of partial pressures

Studies of non-reacting gaseous mixtures showed that in a gaseous mixture each component behaves independently. For a gaseous mixture, it is important to know, how the pressure of individual component contributes to the total pressure of the mixture.

John Dalton stated that "the total pressure of a mixture of non-reacting gases is the sum of partial pressures of the gases present in the mixture" where the partial pressure of a component gas is the pressure that it would exert if it were present alone in the same volume and temperature. This is known as _Dalton’s law of partial pressures_.

_i.e.,_ for a mixture containing three gases 1, 2 and 3 with partial pressures p<sub>1</sub>, p<sub>2</sub> and p<sub>3</sub> in a container with volume V, the total pressure Ptotal will be give by

P<sub>total</sub> = p<sub>1</sub> + p<sub>2</sub> + p<sub>3</sub> ------- (6.12)

Assuming that the gases behave ideally,

$$
P_1 = n1\frac{RT}{V};\quad P_2 = n2\frac{RT}{V};\quad P_3 = n3\frac{RT}{V}
$$


$$
 = (n1+n2+n3)\frac{RT}{V}
$$

$$
P_(Total)= n_(Total)\frac{RT}{V}− − − − − (6.13)
$$

The partial pressure can also be expressed as

$$
\frac{RT}{V}\quad  \frac{P_1}{n_1}\quad \frac{P_2}{n_2}\quad \frac{P_3}{n_3}\quad
$$

$$
can\quad be\quad expressed
$$

$$
\frac{P_1}{n_1}\quad \frac{P_2}{n_2}\quad \frac{P_3}{n_3}
$$

$$
or\quad in\quad general 
$$

$$
\frac{P_i}{n_i}
$$

Therefore

$$
P_{Total}=n_{Total}\frac{P_i}{n_i}=\frac{n_{Total}}{n_i}P_i
$$

$$
P_i=\frac{n_i}{n_{Total}}P_{Total}=x_iP_{Total}------- (6.14)
$$


where x<sub>i</sub> is the mole fraction of the i<sup>th</sup> component.

**Application of Dalton’s law**

In a reaction involving the collection of gas by downward displacement of water, the pressure of dry vapor collected can be calculated using Dalton’s law.

$$
P_{dry\quad gas\quad collected}=p_{Total}-p_{water\quad vapour}
$$

P<sub>watervapour</sub> is generally referred as aqueous tension and its values are available for air at various temperatures.

Let us understand Dalton's law by solving this problem. A mixture of gases contains 4.76 mole of Ne, 0.74 mole of Ar and 2.5 mole of Xe. Calculate the partial pressure of gases, if the total pressure is 2 _atm_. at a fixed temperature.

**Solution:**

$$
P_{Ne}=x_{Ne}P_{Total}
$$

$$
x_{Ne}=\frac{n_{Ne}}{n_{Ne}+n_{Ar}+n_{Xe}}
$$

$$
\quad =\frac{4.67}{4.67+0.74+2.5}= 0.595
$$


$$
x_{Ar}=\frac{n_{Ne}}{n_{Ne}+n_{Ar}+n_{Xe}}
$$

$$
\quad =\frac{0.74}{4.67+0.74+2.5}= 0.093
$$

$$
x_{Xe}=\frac{n_{Ne}}{n_{Ne}+n_{Ar}+n_{Xe}}
$$


$$
\quad =\frac{2.5}{4.67+0.74+2.5}= 0.312
$$

$$
P_{Ne}=X_{Ne}P_{Total}=0.595 × 2= 1.19 atm.
$$


$$
P_{Ar}=X_{Ar}P_{Total}= 0.093 × 2= 0.186 atm.
$$


$$
P_{Xe}=X_{Xe}P_{Total}=0.312 × 2= 0.624 atm.
$$

the ‘air’ tanks of underwater divers for deep dives. For a particular dive 12 dm3 
of O2 at 1 _atm_. and 46 dm3 of He, at 1 _atm._ were both pumped into a 5 dm3 tank.

# 6.4.1 Graham’ s Law of Diffusion

Gases have a tendency to occupy all the available space. When two non -reactive gases are allowed to mix, the gas molecules migrate from region of higher concentration to a region of lower concentration. This property of gas which involves the movement of the gas molecules through another gases is called diffusion. Effusion is another process in which a gas escapes from a container through a very small hole.



**Figure. 6.7 Diffusion and effusion of gases**

The rate of diffusion or effusion is inversely proportional to the square root of molar mass. This statement is called Graham's law of diffusion/effusion.

Mathematically, rate of diffusion M

$$
rate\quad of\quad diffusion\quad α\quad \frac{1}{\sqrt{M}}
$$

Otherwise

$$
\frac{r_A}{r_B}=\sqrt{\frac{M_B}{M_A}}− − − − − − − (6.15)
$$

When diffusing gases are at differrent pressures (P<sub>A</sub> , P<sub>B</sub> ),

$$
\frac{r_A}{r_B}=\frac{P_A}{P_B}\sqrt{\frac{M_B}{M_A}}− − − − − −(6.16)
$$

where r<sub>A</sub> and r<sub>B</sub> are the rates of diffusion of A and B and the M<sub>A</sub> and M<sub>B</sub> are their respective molar masses.

Graham’s Law forms the basis of the process of enriching the isotopes of U235 from other isotopes.

**Example:**

1\. An unknown gas diffuses at a rate of 0.5 time that of nitrogen at the same temperature and pressure. Calculate the molar mass of the unknown gas



Solution:

$$
\frac{rate_{Unknown}}{rate\quad N_2}=\sqrt{\frac{M_{N_2}}{M_{Unknown}}}
$$

$$
0.5=\sqrt{\frac{28 g\quad {mol}^-1}{M_{Unknown}}}
$$

$$
Squaring\quad on\quad both\quad sides
$$

$$
(0.5)^2=\frac{28 g\quad {mol}^-1}{M_{Unknown}}
$$

$$
{M_{Unknown}}=\frac{28}{0.25}=112 g {mol}^ −1
$$
