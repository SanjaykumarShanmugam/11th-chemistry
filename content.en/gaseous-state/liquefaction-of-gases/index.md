**6.7 Liquefaction of gases**

For important commercial operations such as LPG and rocket fuels, we require gases in their liquid state. The liquefication methods are based on the Joule-Thomson effect. He observed appreciable cooling when the compressed gas is forced through an orifice plug into  a low-pressure region. This phenomenon of lowering of temperature when a gas is made to expand adiabatically from a region of high pressure into a region of low pressure is known as Joule- Thomson effect. This effect is observed only below a certain temperature, which is a characteristic one for each gas. This temperature below which a gas obeys Joule-Thomson effect is called inversion temperature (T<sub>i</sub>). This value is given using van der waals constants _a_ and _b_.

$$
T^i=\frac{2a}{Rb}--------- (6.34)
$$


Gases like O<sub>2</sub>, He, N<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub> have very low T<sub>c</sub>, hence Joule-Thomson effect can be applied for cooling effectively. At the inversion temperature, no rise or fall in temperature of a gas occurs while expanding. But above the inversion temperature, the gas gets heated up when allowed to expand through a hole.

There are different methods used for liquefaction of gases:

1) In **Linde’s method,** Joule-Thomson effect is used to get liquid air or any other gas.

2) In **Claude’s process,** the gas is allowed to perform mechanical work in addition to Joule-Thomson effect so that more cooling is produced.

3) In **Adiabatic process,** cooling is produced by removing the magnetic property of magnetic material such as gadolinium sulphate. By this method, a temperature of 10<sup>-4</sup> K i.e. as low as 0 K can be achieved.
