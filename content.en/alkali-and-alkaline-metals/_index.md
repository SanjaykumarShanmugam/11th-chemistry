**Ionisation enthalpy**

Alkali metals have the lowest ionisation enthalpy compared to other elements present in the respective period. As we go down the group, the ionisation enthalpy decreases due to the increase in atomic size. In addition, the number of inner shells also increases, which in turn increases the magnitude of screening effect and consequently, the ionisation enthalpy decreases down the group.

The second ionisation enthalpies of alkali metals are very high. The removal of an electron from the alkali metals gives monovalent cations having stable electronic configurations similar to the noble gas. Therefore, it becomes very difficult to remove the second electron from the stable configurations already attained.

**Hydration enthalpy**

Lithium salts are more soluble than the salts of other metals of group 1. eg. LiClO4 is upto 12 times more soluble than NaClO4. Other salts KClO4, RbClO4 and CsClO4 have solubilities only 10-3 times of that of LiClO4 . The high solubility of Li salts is due to strong solvation of small size Li+ ion.

**Electronegativity:**

Alkali metals have comparatively smaller value of electronegativity than the other elements in the respective period. When they react with other elements, they usually produce ionic compounds. For example, they react with halogens to form ionic halides.

**Flame colour and the spectra:**

When the alkali metal salts moistened with concentrated hydrochloric acid are heated on a platinum wire in a flame, they show characteristic coloured flame as shown below.

**Table 5.4 Flame colour and wavelength**

**5.2.3 Chemical properties of alkali metals**

Alkali metals exhibit high chemical reactivity. The reactivity of alkali metals increases from Li to Cs, since the ionisation energy decreases down the group. All alkali metals are highly reactive towards the more electronegative elements such as oxygen and halogens. Some characteristic chemical properties of alkali metals are described below.

**Reaction with oxygen**

All the alkali metals on exposure to air or oxygen burn vigorously, forming oxides on their surface. Lithium forms only monoxide, sodium forms the monoxide and peroxide and the other elements form monoxide, peroxide, and superoxides. These oxides are basic in nature.

4 Li +O2 2Li2O (simple oxide)

2 Na +O2 Na2O2 (peroxide)

M + O2 MO2 (superoxide) (M= K, Rb,Cs)

**Reaction with hydrogen**

All alkali metals react with hydrogen at about 673 K (lithium at 1073 K) to form the corresponding ionic hydrides. Reactivity of alkali metals with hydrogen decreases from Li to Cs.

2M + H2 2 M+H- (M = Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs)

The ionic character of the hydrides increases from Li to Cs and their stability decreases. The hydrides behave as strong  

reducing agents and their reducing nature increases down the group.

**Reaction with halogen**

Alkali metals combine readily with halogens to form ionic halides MX. Reactivity of alkali metals with halogens increases down the group because of corresponding decrease in ionisation enthalpy.

2M + X2 2 MX (M= Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs) (X= F, Cl, Br, I)

All metal halides are ionic crystals. However Lithium iodide shows covalent character, as it is the smallest cation that exerts high polarising power on the iodide anion. Additionally, the iodide ion being the largest can be polarised to a greater extent by Li+ ion.

**Reaction with liquid ammonia:**

Alkali metals dissolve in liquid ammonia to give deep blue solutions that are conducting in nature. The conductivity is similar to that of pure metals (The specific conductivity of Hg is 104 Ω-1 and for sodium in liquid ammonia is 0.5 x 104 Ω-1). This happens because the alkali metal atom readily loses its valence electron in ammonia solution. Both the cation and the electron are ammoniated to give ammoniated cation and ammoniated electron.

M + (x + y)NH3 →

\[M(NH3)x \] + + \[e(NH3)y \]

−

The blue colour of the solution is due to the ammoniated electron which




  

absorbs energy in the visible region of light and thus imparts blue colour to the solution. The solutions are paramagnetic and on standing slowly liberate hydrogen resulting in the formation of an amide.

M+ + e −+ NH3 → MNH2+ ½H2

In concentrated solution, the blue colour changes to bronze colour and become diamagnetic.

**Reaction with water:**

Alkali metals react with water to give corresponding hydroxides with the liberation of hydrogen.

2 Li + 2 H2O → 2 LiOH+ H2

They also react with alcohol, and alkynes which contain active hydrogens.

2 Na + 2 C2H5OH → 2 C2H5ONa + H2

H-C ≡ C-H Na H-C ≡ C-Na

Na-C ≡ C-Na

N a

**Reducing activity:**

Alkali metals can lose their valence electron readily hence they act as good reducing agents.

M(s) → M+ (g) + e–

**Reaction with carbon:**

Lithium directly reacts with carbon to form the ionic compound, lithium carbide. Other metals do not react with carbon directly. However, when they are treated with compounds like acetylene they form acetelydes.  

2 Li + 2C → Li2C2

**5.2.4 Uses of alkali metals:**

i. Lithium metal is used to make useful alloys. For example with lead it is used to make ‘white metal’ bearings for motor engines, with aluminium to make aircraft parts, and with magnesium to make armour plates. It is used in thermonuclear reactions.

ii. Lithium is also used to make electrochemical cells.

iii. Sodium is used to make Na/Pb alloy needed to make Pb(Et)4 and Pb(Me)4. These organolead compounds were earlier used as anti-knock additives to petrol, but nowadays lead-free petrol in use.

iv. Liquid sodium metal is used as a coolant in fast breeder nuclear reactors.

v. Potassium has a vital role in biological systems.Potassium chloride is used as a fertilizer.

vi. Potassium hydroxide is used in the manufacture of soft soap. It is also used as an excellent absorbent of carbon dioxide.

vii. Caesium is used in devising photoelectric cells.

**5.3 General characteristics of the compounds of alkali metals**

All the common compounds of the alkali metals are generally ionic in nature. General characteristics of some of their compounds are discussed here.




  

**Oxides and Hydroxides**

On combustion in excess of air, alkali metals forms normal oxides with formula M2O. They react with water to form corresponding hydroxides which are basic in nature.

M2O + H2O → 2 MOH

Alkali metals apart from lithium form peroxides in addition to normal oxides upon combustion with excess air. These peroxides produce hydroxides and H2O2 upon reacting with water.

M2O2+2 H2O → 2MOH+H2O2

(M = Na, K, Rb, Cs)

Except lithium and sodium, all the other alkali metals form superoxides also. These superoxides also gives basic hydroxides upon treatment with water.

2 MO2 + 2 H2O → 2 MOH + H2O2 + O2

(M = K, Rb, Cs)

Under appropriate conditions pure compounds M2O, M2O2 or MO2 may be prepared.

**Properties of oxides and hydroxides:**

The oxides and the peroxides are colourless when pure, but the superoxides are yellow or orange in colour. The peroxides are diamagnetic while the superoxides are paramagnetic. Sodium peroxide is widely used as an oxidising agent. The hydroxides which are obtained by the reaction of the oxides with water are all white crystalline solids. The alkali metal hydroxides are strong bases. They  

dissolve in water with evolution of heat on account of intense hydration.

**Halides:**

The alkali metal halides, MX, (X=F, Cl, Br, I) are colourless crystalline solids with high melting points. They can be prepared by the reaction of the appropriate oxide, hydroxide or carbonate with aqueous hydrohalic acid (HX). As the electropositive character of alkali metal increases from Li to Cs, the ease with which the metals form halides increases from Li to Cs. All halides are ionic in nature except LiBr and LiI. Except LiF, all other halides are soluble in water. The low solubility of LiF in water is due to its high lattice enthalpy (small size of Li+ and F-). Due to the presence of covalent nature both LiBr and LiI are soluble in organic solvents.

**Salts of oxo-acids**

Alkali metals form salts with all the oxo-acids. Most of these salts are soluble in water and are thermally stable. As the electropositive character increases down the group, the stability of the carbonates and bicarbonates increases. This is due to the decrease in polarising power of alkali metal cations. The carbonates (M2CO3) of alkali metals are remarkably stable up to 1273 K, above which they first melt and then eventually decompose to form oxides. However, Li2CO3 is considerably less stable and decomposes readily.

Li2CO3 → Δ Li2O + CO2

This is presumably due to large size difference between Li+ and CO3

\-2 which




  

makes the crystal lattice unstable. Being strongly basic, alkali metals except lithium form solid bicarbonates. No other metal forms solid bicarbonates.

M2CO3 + CO2 + H2O → 2 MHCO3

(M = Na, K, Rb, Cs)

All the carbonates and bicarbonates are soluble in water and their solubilities increase rapidly on descending the group. This is due to the reason that lattice energies decrease more rapidly than their hydration energies on moving down the group.

**5.3.1 Important compounds of alkali metals:**

**Sodium Carbonate Na2CO3.10H2O (Washing soda):**

Sodium carbonate is one of the important inorganic compounds used in industries. It is prepared by Solvay process. In this process, ammonia is converted into ammonium carbonate which then converted to ammonium bicarbonate by passing excess carbon dioxide in a sodium chloride solution saturated with ammonia. The ammonium bicarbonate thus formed reacts with the sodium chloride to give sodium bicarbonate and ammonium chloride. As sodium bicarbonate has poor solubility, it gets precipitated. The sodium bicarbonate is isolated and is heated to give sodium carbonate. The equations involved in this process are,

2NH3 + H2O + CO2 → (NH4)2CO3

(NH4)2CO3 + H2O + CO2 → 2 NH4HCO3  

NH4HCO3 + NaCl → NH4Cl + NaHCO3

2 NaHCO3 → Na2CO3 + CO2 + H2O

The ammonia used in this process can be recovered by treating the resultant ammonium chloride solution with calcium hydroxide. Calcium chloride is formed as a by-product.

**Properties:**

Sodium carbonate, commonly known as washing soda, crystallises as decahydrate which is white in colour. It is soluble in water and forms an alkaline solution. Upon heating, it looses the water of crystallisation to form monohydrate. Above 373 K, the monohydrate becomes completely anhydrous and changes to a white powder called soda ash.

Na2CO3·10H2O → Na2CO3·H2O + 9H2O

Na2CO3·H2O → Na2CO3 + H2O

**Uses:**

i. Sodium carbonate known as washing soda and is used mainly for laundering.

ii. It is also used in water treatment to convert the hard water to soft water.

iii. It is used in the manufacturing of glass, paper, paint etc...

**Sodium chloride NaCl (Cooking salt or Table salt):**

Sodium chloride is isolated by evaporation from sea water which contains




  

2.7 to 2.9% by mass. Approximately 50 lakh tons of salt are produced annually in India by solar evaporation. Crude sodium chloride can be obtained by crystallisation of brine solution which contains sodium sulphate, calcium sulphate, calcium chloride and magnesium chloride as impurities. Pure sodium chloride can be obtained from crude salt as follows. Firstly removal of insoluble impurities by filtration from the crude salt solution with minimum amount of water. Sodium chloride can be crystallised by passing HCl gas into this solution. Calcium and magnesium chloride, being more soluble than sodium chloride, remain in solution.

Sodium chloride melts at 1081K. It has a solubility of 36.0 g in 100 g of water at 273 K. The solubility does not increase appreciably with increase in temperature.

**Uses :**

(i) It is used as a common salt or table salt for domestic purpose.

(ii) It is used for the preparation of many inorganic compounds such as NaOH and Na2CO3

**Sodium hydroxide:**

Sodium hydroxide is prepared commercially by the electrolysis of brine solution in Castner-Kellner cell using a mercury cathode and a carbon anode. Sodium metal is discharged at the cathode and combines with mercury to form sodium amalgam. Chlorine gas is evolved at the anode. The sodium amalgam thus obtained is treated with water to give sodium hydroxide.  

At cathode : Na+ + e– → Na(amalgam)

At anode : Cl– → ½ Cl2 ↑+ e–

2Na(amalgam)+2H2O→2NaOH+2Hg+H2↑

Sodium hydroxide is a white, translucent and deliquescent solid, that dissolves in water to give a strong alkaline solution. It melts at 591 K. The sodium hydroxide solution at the surface reacts with the CO2 in the atmosphere to form Na2CO3

**Uses:**

• Sodium hydroxide is used in the purification of bauxite (ore of Aluminium) and petroleum refining

• It is used in the textile industries for mercerising cotton fabrics

• It is used in the manufacture of soap, paper and artificial silks.

**Sodium bicarbonate NaHCO3 (Baking soda):**

Sodium hydrogen carbonate or sodium bicarbonate is used in baking cakes pastries etc. It is called so because it decomposes on heating to generate bubbles of carbon dioxide, leaving holes in cakes or pastries and making them light and fluffy. This compound is prepared by saturating a solution of sodium carbonate with carbon dioxide. The white crystalline powder of sodium bicarbonate, being less soluble, precipitated out.




  

**Uses:**

• Primarily used as an ingredient in baking.

• Sodium hydrogen carbonate is a mild antiseptic for skin infections.

• It is also used in fire extinguishers.

**5.4 Biological importance of sodium and potassium**

Monovalent sodium and potassium ions are found in large proportions in biological fluids. These ions perform important biological functions such as maintenance of ion balance and nerve impulse conduction. A typical 70 kg man contains about 90 g of sodium and 170 g of potassium compared with only 5 g of iron and 0.06 g of copper.

Sodium ions are found primarily on the outside of cells, being located in blood plasma and in the interstitial fluid which surrounds the cells. These ions participate in the transmission of nerve signals, in regulating the flow of water across cell membranes and in the transport of sugars and amino acids into cells. Sodium and potassium, although so similar chemically, differ quantitatively in their ability to penetrate cell membranes, in their transport mechanisms and in their efficiency to activate enzymes. Thus, potassium ions are the most abundant cations within cell fluids, where they activate many enzymes, participate in the oxidation of glucose to produce ATP and, with sodium, are responsible for the transmission of nerve signals.

Sodium–potassium pump play an important role in transmitting nerve signals.  

Figure 5.4 Sodium–potassium pump

**5.5 Alkaline earth metals**

Group 2 in the modern periodic table contains the elements beryllium, magnesium, calcium, strontium, barium and radium. These elements with the exception of beryllium are commonly known as the alkaline earth metals because their oxides and hydroxides are alkaline in nature and these metal oxides are found in the earth’s crust.

**5.5.1 General characteristics of alkaline earth metals**

**Physical state**

Beryllium is rare and radium is the rarest of all comprising only 10 % of igneous rocks. Magnesium and calcium are very common in the earth’s crust, with calcium the fifth-most-abundant element, and magnesium the eighth. Magnesium and calcium are found in many rocks and minerals: magnesium in carnallite, magnesite, dolomite and calcium in chalk, limestone, gypsum. Most strontium is found in the minerals celestite and strontianite. Barium is slightly less common, much of it in the mineral barite. Radium, being a decay product of uranium, is found in all uranium-bearing ores.  

**FIREWORK**

Many alkaline and

alkaline earth metals are used in creating colours, such as strontium and barium, are the colourful stars of a fireworks show. Combined with the element chlorine, barium sends up a green spark, calcium gives orange and lithium gives medium red. Strontium carbonate gives a bright red colour Nitrates of sodium gives orange, potassium and rubidium gives violet colour and caesium gives indigo colour. The burning "excites" the electrons, pushing them into higher than normal energy level; they release their extra energy as a colourful burst of light

The blue fireworks are the hardest to make, since the compound copper chloride breaks down in a hot flame. In recent years, fireworks experts have used magnalium- a mixture of the alkaline earth metal magnesium and aluminium - to boost all firework colours. Magnalium has made the blues brighter, but pyro technicians are still searching for a blue as brilliant as the red, green and yellow colours.

**Atomic and ionic radii**

The atomic and ionic radii of alkaline earth metals are smaller than the corresponding members of the alkali metals. This is due to the fact the Group 2 elements having a higher nuclear charge that allows electrons to be attracted more strongly towards the nucleus. On moving down the group, the radii increases due to gradual increase in the number of the shells and the screening effect.

**Common oxidation state** The group 2 elements have two electrons in their valence shell and by losing these electrons, they acquire the stable noble gas configuration. So these elements exhibit +2 oxidation state in their compounds.

**Ionisation enthalpy**

Due to a fairly large size of the atoms, alkaline earth metals have low ionisation enthalpies when compared to ‘p’ block elements. Down the group the ionisation enthalpy decreases as atomic size increases. This is due to the addition of new shells as well as increase in the magnitude of the screening effect of inner shell electrons. Members of group 2 have higher ionization enthalpy values than group 1 because of their smaller size, with electrons being more attracted towards the nucleus of the atoms. Correspondingly they are less electropositive than alkali metals.

**Figure 5.6 Variation of ionisation energy - Alkaline earth metals.**

Although IE1 values of alkaline earth metals are higher than that of alkali metals, the IE2 values of alkaline earth metals are much smaller than those of alkali metals. This occurs because in alkali metals the second electron is to be removed from a cation, which has already acquired a noble gas configuration. In the case of alkaline earth metals, the second electron is to be removed from a monovalent cation, which still has one electron in the outermost shell. Thus, the second electron can be removed more easily in the case of group 2 elements than in group 1 elements.

**Hydration Enthalpies**

Compounds of alkaline earth metals are more extensively hydrated than those of alkali metals, because the hydration enthalpies of alkaline earth metal ions are larger than those of alkali metal ions.  

Like alkali metal ions, the hydration enthalpies of alkaline earth metal ions also decrease with increase in ionic size down the group.

Be > Mg > Ca > Sr > Ba

e.g., Magnesium chloride and calcium chloride exist as their hydrated crystals MgCl2.6H2O and CaCl2. 6H2O respectively. whereas NaCl and KCl do not form such hydrates.

**Electronegativity**

In alkaline earth metals the electronegativity values decrease as we go down the group as seen in the alkali metals.

**Flame colour and the spectra:**

When the alkaline earth metal salts moistened with concentrated hydrochloric acid are heated on a platinum wire in a flame, they show characteristic coloured flame as shown below.

**Table 5.10 Flame Colour and wavelength**

The heat in the flame excites the valence electron to a higher energy level. when it drops back to its actual energy level, the excess energy is emitted as light, whose wavelength is in the visible region as shown in the above table.

**5.6. General characteristics of the compounds of the alkaline earth metals**

The dipositive oxidation state (M2+) is the predominant valence of group 2 elements. The alkaline earth metals form compounds which are predominantly ionic. However, they are less ionic than  

the corresponding compounds of alkali metals. This is due to increased nuclear charge and smaller size. The general characteristics of some of the compounds of alkaline earth metals are described below.

**(a) Oxides**

Generally alkaline earth metals form monoxides and peroxides.

**Monoxides**

Monoxides are obtained by heating the metals in oxygen. BeO and MgO are almost insoluble in water. On the other hand, oxides of other elements form hydroxides. BeO is amphoteric; MgO is weakly basic while CaO, SrO and BaO are strongly basic.

BeO oxide is covalent due to the small size of Be2+ion,while other oxides are ionic in nature.

**Peroxides**

Except beryllium, all the remaining metals form peroxides. It is prepared by heating monoxides with oxygen at high temperature.

2 BaO +O2 2 BaO2

**b)Hydroxides:**

All the oxides except BeO are basic in nature and react with water to form sparingly soluble hydroxides.

MO + H2O →M(OH)2

The solubility, thermal stability




  

and the basic character of the hydroxides increase down the group. The alkaline earth metal hydroxides are, however, less basic and less stable than alkali metal hydroxides. Beryllium hydroxide is amphoteric in nature as it reacts with both acid and alkali.

Be(OH)2 + 2 NaOH → Na2BeO2 +2H2O

Be(OH)2 + 2HCl → BeCl2 +2H2O

**c) Halides:**

Alkaline earth metals form halides with general formula MX2. They can be prepared by heating metals with halogens on heating.

M +X2 MX2

Beryllium halides are covalent on account of smaller size of Be+2. Beryllium halides are hygroscopic, fume in moist air and soluble in organic solvents. Beryllium chloride has a chain structure in the solid state as shown in figure 5.9 (structure-a). In the vapour phase BeCl2 tends to form a chloro-bridged dimer (structure-c) which dissociates into the linear monomer at high temperatures of the order of 1200 K. (structure-b).

Except beryllium halides, all the other halides of alkaline earth metals are ionic in nature. Chloride and fluorides of the other metals are ionic solids. These are good conductors of electricity in fused state and in aqueous solutions. The tendency to form halide hydrates gradually decreases (for example, MgCl2..8H2O, CaCl2.6H2O, SrCl2.6H2O and BaCl2.2H2O) down the group.

**Figure 5.9 Structure of beryllium chloride**

**Salts of oxo acids**

The alkaline earth metals form salts of oxo acids. Some of these are given below:

**Carbonates:**

All the carbonates decompose on heating to give carbon dioxide and the oxide.

**MCO3 MO + CO2 ∆**

• The solubility of carbonates in water decreases down the group.

• The thermal stability increases down the group with increasing cationic size.

| Mg |540 |895 |
| Ca |900 |1149 |
| Sr |1290 |1374 |
| Ba |1360 |- |
  

**Sulphates:**

The sulphates of the alkaline earth metals are all white solids and stable to heat. BeSO4, and MgSO4 are readily soluble in water; the solubility decreases from CaSO4 to BaSO4. The greater hydration enthalpies of Be2+ and Mg2+ ions overcome the lattice enthalpy factor and therefore their sulphates are soluble in water.

**Nitrates:**

The nitrates are made by dissolution of the carbonates in dilute nitric acid. Magnesium nitrate crystallises with six molecules of water, whereas barium nitrate crystallises as the anhydrous salt. This again shows a decreasing tendency to form hydrates with increasing size. All of them decompose on heating to give the oxide.

**5.6.1 Important compounds of calcium**

**Quick lime, CaO**

**Preparation**

It is produced on a commercial scale by heating limestone in a lime kiln in the temperature range 1070-1270K.

CaCO3 ⇌ CaO + CO2

The reaction being reversible, carbon dioxide is removed as soon as it is produced to enable the reaction to proceed to completion.

**Properties**

Calcium oxide is a white amorphous solid.

It has a melting point of 2870 K.  

(i)It absorbs moisture and carbon dioxide on exposure to atmosphere.

CaO + H2O → Ca(OH)2

CaO + CO2 → CaCO3

(ii)The addition of limited amount of water breaks the lump of lime. This process is called slaking of lime and the product is slaked lime. CaO + H2O → Ca(OH)2

(iii)The mixtureof Quick lime(CaO) and sodium hydroxide is called soda lime.

(iv)It combines with acidic oxides such as SiO2 and P4O10 to form CaSiO3 and Ca3(PO4)2, respectively.

CaO + SiO2 → CaSiO3

6CaO + P4O10 → 2Ca3(PO4)2

**Uses** Calcium oxide is used (i) to manufacture cement, mortar and

glass.

(ii) in the manufacture of sodium carbonate and slaked lime.

(iii) in the purification of sugar.

(iv) as a drying agent.

**5.6.2 Calcium hydroxide**

**Preparation**

Calcium hydroxide is prepared by adding water to quick lime, CaO.

**Properties**

It is a white powder. It is sparingly soluble in water. The aqueous solution is known as lime water and a suspension of slaked lime in water is known as milk of lime.

When carbon dioxide is passed through lime water, it turns milky due to the formation of calcium carbonate.

Ca(OH)2 + CO2 → CaCO3 + H2O

On passing excess of carbon dioxide, the precipitate dissolves to form calcium hydrogen carbonate.

CaCO3 + CO2 + H2O → Ca(HCO3)2

Milk of lime reacts with chlorine  

to form hypochlorite, a constituent of bleaching powder.

2Ca (OH)2 + 2Cl2 →

CaCl2 + Ca(OCl)2 + 2H2O

**Uses:**

Calcium hydroxide is used

(i) in the preparation of mortar, a building material.

ii) in white wash due to its disinfectant nature.

(iii) in glass making, in tanning industry, in the preparation of bleaching powder and for the purification of sugar.

**5.6.3 Gypsum (CaSO4.2H2O)**

Gypsum beds were formed due to the evaporation of water from the massive prehistoric sea basins. When water evaporates, the minerals present in it become concentrated, and crystallise.

**Figure 5.11 A Gypsum Quarry**

**Properties of Gypsum**

• Gypsum is a soft mineral, which is moderately soluble in water. The solubility of this mineral in water is




  

affected by temperature. Unlike other salts, gypsum becomes less soluble in water as the temperature increases. This is known as retrograde solubility, which is a distinguishing characteristic of gypsum.

• Gypsum is usually white, colorless, or gray in color. But sometimes, it can also be found in the shades of pink, yellow, brown, and light green, mainly due to the presence of impurities.

• Gypsum crystals are sometimes found to occur in a form that resembles the petals of a flower. This type of formation is referred to as ‘desert rose’, as they mostly occur in arid areas or desert terrains.

• Gypsum is known to have low thermal conductivity, which is the reason why it is used in making drywalls or wallboards. Gypsum is also known as a natural insulator.

Figure 5.12 -**The Alabaster Variety of**

**Gypsum**

• Alabaster is a variety of gypsum, that is highly valued as an ornamental stone. It has been used by the sculptors for centuries. Alabaster is granular and opaque.  

• Gypsum has hardness between 1.5 to 2 on Moh’s Hardness Scale. Its specific gravity is 2.3 to 2.4.

**Uses of Gypsum**

• The alabaster variety of gypsum was used in ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia by the sculptors. The ancient Egyptians knew how to turn gypsum into plaster of Paris about 5,000 years ago. Today, gypsum has found a wide range of uses and applications in human society, some of which are enlisted below.

• Gypsum is used in making drywalls or plaster boards. Plaster boards are used as the finish for walls and ceilings, and for partitions.

• Another important use of gypsum is the production of plaster of Paris. Gypsum is heated to about 300 degree Fahrenheit to produce plaster of Paris, which is also known as gypsum plaster. It is mainly used as a sculpting material.

• Gypsum is used in making surgical and orthopedic casts, such as surgical splints and casting moulds.

• Gypsum plays an important role in agriculture as a soil additive, conditioner, and fertilizer. It helps loosen up compact or clay soil, and provides calcium and sulphur, which are essential for the healthy growth of a plant. It can also be used for removing sodium ion from soils having excess salinity.




  

• Gypsum is used in toothpastes, shampoos, and thickening properties.

• Gypsum is a component of Portland ceme control the speed at which concrete sets.

• To sum up, gypsum is one of the most ab applications. Mining of gypsum is simpl thick beds near the Earth’s surface. Howe considerable damage to the environment. importance has been given to recycle this

**SUMM**

The elements belonging to groups 1 and 2 of the modern periodic table are called s-block elements. They are called so because the valence electron occupies the s orbitals. The group 1 elements have a general outer electronic configuration ns1 and are called alkali metals. The group 2 elements have a general outer electronic configuration ns2 and these are called alkaline earth metals as they are found in earth’s crust and their oxides and hydroxides are alkaline in nature. Elements belonging to group 1 and 2 are highly reactive and forms M+ and M2+

cations respectively. Their physical and chemical properties of both groups show a regular trend as we move down the group. The atomic and ionic radii increase as we move down the group while their ionisation enthalpies decrease.

The first element in each of these groups, lithium in Group 1 and beryllium in Group 2 shows some difference in behaviour with the elements in rest of their groups and show similarities in properties to the second member of the next group. This behaviour is known as the ‘diagonal relationship’ in the periodic table.

The alkali metals are soft and silvery white in colour with low melting points. They are highly reactive. The compounds of alkali metals are predominantly ionic. They form metal hydrides and halides with hydrogen and halogens respectively. Their oxides and hydroxides are soluble in water forming  

**ARY**

strong alkalies. Important compounds of sodium include sodium carbonate, sodium chloride, sodium hydroxide and sodium hydrogen carbonate. Sodium hydroxide is manufactured by Castner-Kellner process and sodium carbonate by Solvay process.

The chemistry of alkaline earth metals is similar to alkali metals. However, we observe some differences because of their reduced atomic and ionic sizes and increased cationic charges. Their oxides and hydroxides are less basic than the alkali metal oxides and hydroxides. They also form hydrides and halides with hydrogen and halogens respectively. Industrially important compounds of calcium include calcium oxide (lime), calcium hydroxide (slaked lime), calcium sulphate hemihydrate (Plaster of Paris), calcium carbonate (limestone) and cement. Portland cement is an important constructional material. It is manufactured by heating a pulverised mixture of limestone and clay in a rotary kiln. The clinker thus obtained is mixed with some gypsum (2-3%) to give a fine powder of cement. All these substances find variety of uses in different areas.

Monovalent sodium and potassium ions and divalent magnesium and calcium ions are found in large proportions in biological fluids. These ions perform important biological functions such as maintenance of ion balance and nerve impulse conduction.
