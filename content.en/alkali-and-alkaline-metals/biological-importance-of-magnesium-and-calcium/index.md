**5.7 Biological importance of magnesium and calcium**

Magnesium and calcium also plays a vital role in biological functions. A typical
adult human body contains about 25 g of magnesium and 1200 g of calcium. Magnesium
plays an important role in many biochemical reactions catalysed by enzymes. It is the
co-factor of all enzymes that utilize ATP in phosphate transfer and energy release. It also
essential for DNA synthesis and is responsible for the stability and proper functioning
of DNA. It is also used for balancing electrolytes in our body. Deficiency of magnesium
results into convulsion and neuromuscular irritation.
 Calcium is a major component of bones and teeth. It is also present in in blood
and its concentration is maintained by hormones (calcitonin and parathyroid hormone).
Deficiency of calcium in blood causes it to take longer time to clot. It is also important for
muscle contraction.
 The main pigment that is responsible for photosynthesis, chlorophyll, contains
magnesium which plays an important role in photosynthesis.
